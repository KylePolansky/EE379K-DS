Specifically: choose a covariance matrix that has the above correlations structure, and write this down. Then find a way to generate samples from this Gaussian. Choose one of the non-zero covariance terms ($C_{ij}$ , if $C$ denotes your covariance matrix) and plot it vs the estimated covariance term, as the number of samples you use scales. The goal is to get a visual representation of how the empirical covariance converges to the true (or family) covariance."
