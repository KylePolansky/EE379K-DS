Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

Abstract

Uniform deviation bounds limit the difference be-
tween a model’s expected loss and its loss on a
random sample uniformly for all models in a learn-
ing problem. In this paper, we provide a novel
framework to obtain uniform deviation bounds
for unbounded loss functions. As a result, we
obtain competitive uniform deviation bounds for
k-Means clustering under weak assumptions on
the underlying distribution. If the fourth moment
com-

is bounded, we prove a rate of O(cid:16)
pared to the previously known O(cid:16)

rate.
We further show that this rate also depends on the
kurtosis — the normalized fourth moment which
measures the “tailedness” of the distribution. We
also provide improved rates under progressively
stronger assumptions, namely, bounded higher
moments, subgaussianity and bounded support of
the underlying distribution.

1. Introduction
Empirical risk minimization — i.e. the training of models on
a ﬁnite sample drawn i.i.d from an underlying distribution
— is a central paradigm in machine learning. The hope is
that models trained on the ﬁnite sample perform provably
well even on previously unseen samples from the underly-
ing distribution. But how many samples m are required
to guarantee a low approximation error ? Uniform devi-
ation bounds provide the answer. Informally, they are the
worst-case difference across all possible models between
the empirical loss of a model and its expected loss. As such,
they determine how many samples are required to achieve a
ﬁxed error in terms of the loss function. In this paper, we
consider the popular k-Means clustering problem and pro-
vide uniform deviation bounds based on weak assumptions
on the underlying data generating distribution.

Related work. Traditional Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory
provides tools to obtain uniform deviation bounds for bi-
nary concept classes such as classiﬁcation using halfspaces
(Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971). While these results have
been extended to provide uniform deviation bounds for sets
of continuous functions bounded in [0, 1] (Haussler, 1992;
Li et al., 2001), these results are not readily applied to k-
Means clustering as the underlying loss function in k-Means
clustering is continuous and unbounded.
In their seminal work, Pollard (1981) shows that k-Means
clustering is strongly consistent, i.e., that the optimal cluster
centers on a random sample converge almost surely to the
optimal centers of the distribution under a weak assump-
tion. This has sparked a long line of research on cluster
stability (Ben-David et al., 2006; Rakhlin & Caponnetto,
2007; Shamir & Tishby, 2007; 2008) which investigates the
convergence of optimal parameters both asymptotically and
for ﬁnite samples. The vector quantization literature offers
insights into the convergence of empirically optimal quan-
tizers for k-Means in terms of the objective: A minimax
is known if the underlying distribution
has bounded support (Linder et al., 1994; Bartlett et al.,

rate of O(cid:16)
1998). A better rate of O(cid:0)m−1(cid:1) may be achieved for ﬁ-

nite support (Antos et al., 2005) or under both bounded
support and regularity assumptions (Levrard et al., 2013).
Ben-David (2007) provides a uniform convergence result for
center based clustering under a bounded support assumption
and Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013) prove uniform deviation
bounds for k-Means clustering if the underlying distribution
satisﬁes moment assumptions (see Section 4).
Empirical risk minimization with fat-tailed losses has been
studied in Mendelson et al. (2014), Mendelson (2014),
Gr¨unwald & Mehta (2016) and Dinh et al. (2016). Dinh et al.
(2016) provide fast learning rates for k-Means clustering
but under stronger assumptions than the ones considered in
this paper. Guarantees similar to uniform deviation bounds
can be obtained using importance sampling in the context
of coreset construction (Bachem et al., 2015; Lucic et al.,
2016; 2017).
Our contributions. We provide a new framework to obtain
uniform deviation bounds for unbounded loss functions. We
apply it to k-Means clustering and provide uniform devi-
for ﬁnite samples

under weak assumptions. In contrast to prior work, our
bounds are all scale-invariant and hold for any set of k clus-
ter centers (not only for a restricted solution set). We show
that convergence depends on the kurtosis of the underly-
ing distribution, which is the normalized fourth moment
and measures the “tailedness” of a distribution. If bounded
higher moments are available, we provide improved bounds
that depend upon the normalized higher moments and we
sharpen them even further under the stronger assumptions
of subgaussianity and bounded support.

2. Problem statement for k-Means
We ﬁrst focus on uniform deviation bounds for k-Means
clustering, and defer the (more technical) framework for
unbounded loss functions to Section 5. We consider the
d-dimensional Euclidean space and deﬁne
(cid:107)x − q(cid:107)2

d(x, Q)2 = min

for any x ∈ Rd and any ﬁnite set Q ⊂ Rd. Furthermore,
slightly abusing the notation, for any x, y ∈ Rd, we set
d(x, y)2 = d(x,{y})2 = (cid:107)x − y(cid:107)2
2.
Statistical k-Means. Let P be any distribution on Rd with
µ = EP [x] and σ2 = EP
Q ⊂ Rd of k ∈ N cluster centers, the expected quantization
error is given by EP
k-Means problem is to ﬁnd a set of k cluster centers such
that the expected quantization error is minimized.
Empirical k-Means. Let X denote a ﬁnite set of points in
Rd. The goal of the empirical k-Means problem is to ﬁnd
a set Q of k cluster centers in Rd such that the empirical
quantization error φX (Q) is minimized, where

Empirical risk minimization. In practice, the underlying
data distribution P in statistical learning problems is often
unknown. Instead, one is only able to observe independent
samples from P . The empirical risk minimization principle
advocates that ﬁnding a good solution on a random sam-
ple Xm also provides provably good solutions to certain
statistical learning problems if enough samples m are used.
Uniform deviation bounds. For k-Means, such a result
may be shown by bounding the deviation between the ex-
pected loss and the empirical error, i.e.,

(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm (Q) − EP

(cid:2)d(x, Q)2(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

uniformly for all possible clusterings Q ∈ Rd×k. If this
difference is sufﬁciently small for a given m, one may then
solve the empirical k-Means problem on Xm and obtain
provable guarantees on the expected quantization error.

3. Uniform deviation bounds for k-Means
A simple approach would be to bound the deviation by an
absolute error , i.e., to require that

(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm(Q) − EP

(cid:2)d(x, Q)2(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 

uniformly for a set of possible solutions (Telgarsky & Das-
gupta, 2013). However, in this paper, we provide uniform
deviation bounds of a more general form: For any distri-
bution P and a sample of m = f (, δ, k, d, P ) points, we
require that with probability at least 1 − δ

(2)
uniformly for all Q ∈ Rd×k. The terms on the right-hand
side may be interpreted as follows: The ﬁrst term based on
the variance σ2 corresponds to a scale-invariant, additive
approximation error. The second term is a multiplicative ap-
proximation error that allows the guarantee to hold even for
solutions Q with a large expected quantization error. Similar
additive error terms were recently explored by Bachem et al.
(2016; 2017) in the context of seeding for k-Means.
There are three key reasons why we choose (2) over (1):
First, (1) is not scale-invariant and may thus not hold for
classes of distributions that are equal up to scaling. Sec-
ond, (1) may not hold for an unbounded solution space, e.g.
Rd×k. Third, we can always rescale P to unit variance and
restrict ourselves to solutions Q with EP
Then, (2) implies (1) for a suitable transformation of P .
Importance of scale-invariance. If we scale all the points
in a data set X and all possible sets of solutions Q by some
λ > 0, then the empirical quantization error is scaled by
λ2. Similarly, if we consider the random variable λx where
x ∼ P , then the expected quantization error is scaled by
λ2. At the same time, the k-Means problem remains the
same: an optimal solution of the scaled problem is simply a
scaled optimal solution of the original problem. Crucially,
however, it is impossible to achieve the guarantee in (1) for
distributions that are equal up to scaling: Suppose that (1)
holds for some error tolerance , and sample size m with
probability at least 1 − δ. Consider a distribution P and a
solution Q ∈ Rd×k such that with probability at least δ

the random variable λx where x ∼ P and let ˜Xm consist of

which contradicts (1) for the distribution ˜P and the solu-
tion ˜Q. Hence, (1) cannot hold for both P and its scaled
transformation ˜P .
Unrestricted solution space One way to guarantee scale-
invariance would be require that

(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm(Q) − EP

(cid:2)d(x, Q)2(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ σ2

(3)
for all Q ∈ Rd×k. However, while (3) is scale-invariant, it is
also impossible to achieve for all solutions Q as the follow-
ing example shows. For simplicity, consider the 1-Means
problem in 1-dimensional space and let P be a distribution
with zero mean. Let Xm denote m independent samples
from P and denote by ˆµ the mean of Xm. For any ﬁnite m,
suppose that ˆµ (cid:54)= 0 with high probability2 and consider a
solution Q consisting of a single point q ∈ R. We then have

(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm({q}) − EP
(cid:2)d(x,{q})2(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12)
=(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm({ˆµ}) + d(ˆµ, q)2 − σ2 − d(0, q)2(cid:12)(cid:12)
=(cid:12)(cid:12)φXm({ˆµ}) − σ2 + q2 − 2q ˆµ + ˆµ2 − q2(cid:12)(cid:12)

(4)

(cid:2)d(x, Q)2(cid:3).

Since ˆµ (cid:54)= 0 with high probability, clearly this expression
diverges as q → ∞ and thus (3) cannot hold for arbitrary
solutions Q ∈ Rd×k. Intuitively, the key issue is that both
the empirical and the statistical error become unbounded as
q → ∞. Previous approaches such as Telgarsky & Dasgupta
(2013) solve this issue by restricting the solution space from
Rd×k to solutions that are no worse than some threshold. In
contrast, we allow the deviation between the empirical and
the expected quantization error to scale with EP
Arbitrary distributions. Finally, we show that we either
need to impose assumptions on P or equivalently make the
relationship between m,  and δ in (2) depend on the under-
lying distribution P . Suppose that there exists a sample size
m ∈ N, an error tolerance  ∈ (0, 1) and a maximal failure
probability δ ∈ (0, 1) such that (2) holds for any distribution
P . Let P be the Bernoulli distribution on {0, 1} ⊂ R with
P [x = 1] = p for p ∈ (δ 1
m , 1). By design, we have µ = p,
σ2 = p(1 − p) and EP
with probability at least δ, the set Xm of m independent
samples from P consists of m copies of a point at one.
Hence, (2) implies that with probability at least 1 − δ

(cid:2)d(x, 1)2(cid:3) = (1 − p). Furthermore,
(cid:2)d(x, 1)2(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ EP

thus lead to a contradiction with  ∈ (0, 1).

4. Key results for k-Means
In this section, we present our main results for k-Means and
defer the analysis and proofs to Sections 6.

4.1. Kurtosis bound

Similar to Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013), the weakest as-
sumption that we require is that the fourth moment of
d(x, µ) for x ∈ P is bounded.3 Our results are based on the
kurtosis of P which we deﬁne as

(cid:2)d(x, µ)4(cid:3)

.

σ4

EP

ˆM4 =

The kurtosis is the normalized fourth moment and is a scale-
invariant measure of the “tailedness” of a distribution. For
example, the normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, while
more heavy tailed distributions such as the t-Student dis-
tribution or the Pareto distribution have a potentially un-
bounded kurtosis. A natural interpretation of the kurtosis is
provided by Moors (1986). For simplicity, consider a data
set with unit variance. Then, the kurtosis may be restated as
the shifted variance of d(x, µ)2, i.e.,

ˆM4 = Var(cid:0)d(x, µ)2(cid:1) + 1.

(cid:2)d(x, µ)2(cid:3)
(cid:2)d(x, µ)2(cid:3) and provides a

This provides a valuable insight into why the kurtosis is rel-
evant for our setting: For simplicity, suppose we would like
to estimate the expected quantization error EP
by the empirical quantization error φXm({µ}) on a ﬁnite
sample Xm.4 Then, the kurtosis measures the dispersion
of d(x, µ)2 around its mean EP
bound on how many samples are required to achieve an error
of . While this simple example provides the key insight
for the trivial solution Q = {µ}, it requires a non-trivial
effort to extend the guarantee in (2) to hold uniformly for
all solutions Q ∈ Rd×k.
With the use of a novel framework to learn unbounded loss
functions (presented in Section 5), we are able to provide
the following guarantee for k-Means.
Theorem 1 (Kurtosis). Let , δ ∈ (0, 1) and k ∈ N. Let P
be any distribution on Rd with kurtosis ˆM4 < ∞. For

tive dk log k + log 1

logarithmic dependence on 1
δ compared to the polynomial
dependence for the bounds based on bounded higher mo-
ments. The sufﬁcient sample size further scales linearly
with the (scale-invariant) subgaussianity parameters a and b.
For example, if P is a one-dimensional normal distribution
of any scale, we would have a = 2 and b = 1.

4.4. Bounded support

The strongest assumption that we consider is if the support
of P is bounded by a hypersphere in Rd with diameter
R > 0. This ensures that almost surely d(x, µ) ≤ R and
hence ˆM4 ≤ R4

5. Framework for unbounded loss functions
To obtain the results presented in Section 4, we propose a
novel framework to uniformly approximate the expected
values of a set of unbounded functions based on a random
sample. We consider a function family F mapping from
an arbitrary input space X to R≥0 and a distribution P
on X . We further require a generalization of the Vapnik-
Chervonenkis dimension to continuous, unbounded func-
tions5 — the pseudo-dimension.
Deﬁnition 1 (Haussler (1992); Li et al. (2001)). The pseudo-
dimension of a set F of functions from X to R≥0, de-
noted by Pdim(F), is the largest d(cid:48) such there is a se-
quence x1, . . . , xd(cid:48) of domain elements from X and a se-
quence r1, . . . , rd(cid:48) of reals such that for each b1, . . . , bd(cid:48) ∈
{above, below}, there is an f ∈ F such that for all
i = 1, . . . , d(cid:48), we have f (xi) ≥ ri ⇐⇒ bi = above.
Similar to the VC dimension, the pseudo-dimension mea-
sures the cardinality of the largest subset of X that can be
shattered by the function family F. Informally, the pseudo-
dimension measures the richness of F and plays a critical
role in providing a uniform approximation guarantee across
all f ∈ F. With this notion, we are able to state the main
result in our framework.
Theorem 5. Let  ∈ (0, 1), δ ∈ (0, 1) and t > 0. Let F
be a family of functions from X to R≥0 with Pdim(F ) =
d < ∞. Let s : X → R≥0 be a function such that s(x) ≥
supf∈F f (x) for all x ∈ X . Let P be any distribution on
X and for

Applying Theorem 5 to a function family F requires three
steps: First, one needs to bound the pseudo-dimension of

5The pseudo-dimension was originally deﬁned for sets of func-
tions mapping to [0, 1] (Haussler, 1992; Li et al., 2001). However,
it is trivially extended to unbounded functions mapping to R≥0.

Ideally, such a bound should be as tight as possible. Third,
one needs to ﬁnd some t > 0 and a sample size

.

(cid:104)

s(x)2(cid:105)

(cid:104)

s(x)2(cid:105)

Finding such a bound usually entails examining the tail
behavior of s(x)2 under P . Furthermore, it is evident that
a bound t may only be found if EP
is bounded
and that assumptions on the distribution P are required. In
Section 6, we will see that for k-Means a function s(x)
< ∞ may be found if the kurtosis of P is
with EP
bounded.
We defer the proof of Theorem 5 to Section B of the Supple-
mentary Materials and provide a short proof sketch that cap-
tures the main insight. The proof is based on symmetrization,
the bounding of covering numbers and chaining — com-
mon techniques in the empirical process literature (Pollard,
1984; Li et al., 2001; Boucheron et al., 2013; Koltchinskii,
2011; van der Vaart & Wellner, 1996). The novelty lies in
considering loss functions f (·) and cover functions s(·) in
Theorem 5 that are potentially unbounded.

Proof sketch. Our proof is based on a double sampling ap-
proach. Let xm+1, xm+2, . . . , x2m be an additional m in-
dependent samples from P and let σ1, σ2, . . . , σm be inde-
pendent random variables uniformly sampled from {−1, 1}.
Then, we show that, if EP
of (6) not holding may be bounded by the probability that
there exists a f ∈ F such that

s(x)2(cid:105) ≤ t, the probability

The key difﬁculty in proving Lemma 5 is that the functions
f ∈ F are not bounded uniformly in [0, 1]. To this end,
we provide in Lemma 4 a novel result that bounds the size
of -packings of F if the functions f ∈ F are bounded in
expectation. Based on Lemma 5, we then prove the main
claim of Theorem 5.

We ﬁrst provide the intuition for a single function f ∈ F and
then show how we extend it to all f ∈ F. While the function
f (x) is not bounded, for a given sample x1, x2, . . . , x2m,
each f (xi) is contained within [0, s(xi)]. Given the sample
x1, x2, . . . , x2m, the random variable σi (f (xi) − f (xi+m)
is bounded in 0± max (s(xi), s(xi+m)) and has zero mean.
Hence, given independent samples x1, x2, . . . , x2m, the
probability of (7) occurring for a single f ∈ F can be

that E [s(x)]2 is bounded if and only if the kurtosis of P is

7. Conclusion
We have presented a framework to uniformly approximate
the expected value of unbounded functions on a sample.
With this framework we are able to provide theoretical guar-
antees for empirical risk minimization in k-Means clustering
if the kurtosis of the underlying distribution is bounded. In
particular, we obtain state-of-the art bounds on the sufﬁcient
number of samples to achieve a given uniform approxima-
tion error. If the underlying distribution fulﬁlls stronger
assumptions, such as bounded higher moments, subgaus-
sianity or bounded support, our analysis yields progressively
better bounds. We conjecture that Theorem 5 can be applied
to other related problems such as hard and soft Bregman
clustering, likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture mod-
els, as well as nonparametric clustering problems. However,
such results do not follow immediately and require addi-
tional arguments beyond the scope of this paper.

This allows us to bound the expected number of dichotomies

Proof. Our proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 6
in Haussler (1992). The difference is that we consider a
function family F that is not uniformly bounded but only
bounded in expectation. The key idea is to construct a ran-
dom sample and to use the expected number of dichotomies
on that set to bound the size of an -packing by the pseudo-
dimension.
Noting that by deﬁnition s(x) ≥ 0 and EQ [s(x)] < ∞, we

Let (cid:126)x = (x1, x2, . . . , xm) be a random vector in X m, where
each xi is drawn independently at random from ˜Q. Given
(cid:126)x, let (cid:126)r = (r1, r2, . . . , rm) be a random vector, where each
ri is drawn independently at random from a uniform distri-
bution on [0, s(xi)].

For any vector (cid:126)z ∈ Rm, we deﬁne

F, we denote

any f

the

sign((cid:126)z) = (sign(z1), . . . , sign(zm)) .

The set of dichotomies induced by (cid:126)r on F(cid:126)x is given by

sign(F(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r) = {sign(f(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r) | f ∈ F} .

For m ≥ d, Sauer’s Lemma (Sauer, 1972; Vapnik & Cher-
vonenkis, 1971) bounds the size of this set by
|sign(F(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r)| ≤ (em/d)d,

for all (cid:126)x ∈ X m and (cid:126)r ∈ Rm. Hence, the expected number
of dichotomies is also bounded, i.e.

E [|sign(F(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r)|] ≤ (em/d)d.

For j ∈ N, let γj = EQ [s(x)] /2j. We deﬁne a sequence
G1,G2, . . . ,G∞ of γj-packings of F as follows: Let the set
G0 consist of an arbitrary element f ∈ F. For any j ∈ N,
we initialize Gj to Gj−1. Then, we select a single element
f ∈ F with dL1(Q)(f,Gj) > γj and add it to Gj. We repeat
this until no such element f ∈ F with dL1(Q)(f,Gj) > γj
is left. By deﬁnition, Gj is an γj-packing of F with respect
to dL1(Q). Hence, for any f ∈ F, we have

dL1(Q)(f,Gj) ≤ γj = EQ [s(x)] /2j.

(29)

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

By Lemma 4, the size of Gj is bounded by

|Gj|≤ 2(2e2j)2d = 22d(j+1)+1e2d.

(30)
For each f ∈ F and j ∈ N, we deﬁne the closest element
in Gj by

φj(f ) = arg min
g∈Gj

dL1(Q)(f, g).

By (30), Gj is ﬁnite for each j ∈ N and the minimum is
well-deﬁned.
We construct the following sequence H1,H2, . . . ,H∞: Let
H1 be equal to G1. For each j ∈ {2, 3, . . . ,∞}, we deﬁne

Hj = {g − φj−1(g) : g ∈ Gj} .

For all j ∈ N and h ∈ Hj, there is hence a gh ∈ Gj such
that h = gh(x) − φj−1(gh). By (29), we thus have for all
j ∈ N and h ∈ Hj

EQ [|h(x)|] = dL1(Q)(gh,Gj−1) ≤ γj−1.

(31)

Furthermore, by (30), we have for all j ∈ N
|Hj|≤ |Gj|≤ 22d(j+1)+1e2d.

(32)
The key idea is that intuitively any f ∈ F can be ad-
ditively decomposed into functions from the sequence
H1,H2, . . . ,H∞. By deﬁnition, for any j ∈ N, any func-
tion g ∈ Gj can be rewritten as

where (hg,1, hg,2, . . . , hg,j) are functions in H1 × H2 ×

Clearly, G is dense in F with respect to dL1(Q). We claim
that, as a consequence,

∃f ∈ F :

σi(f (xi) − f (xi+m))

if and only if

∃g ∈ G :

We now use Hoeffding’s inequality to bound the probability
that

for a single j ∈ N and h ∈ Hj.
For i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}, consider the random variables

Xi = σi(h(xi) − h(xi+m)).

Since σi are uniformly drawn at random from {−1, 1}, we
have E [Xi] = 0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. Furthermore,
each Xi is bounded in

[ai, bi] = [0 ± (h(xi) − h(xi+m))].

C. Proof of Lemma 1
Proof. We ﬁrst show (9) with the same notation as in the
proof of Lemma 4. For any f ∈ F, (cid:126)x ∈ X m and (cid:126)r ∈ Rm,
we denote the restriction (f (x1), . . . , f (xm)) by f(cid:126)x and set
F(cid:126)x = {f(cid:126)x | f ∈ F}. For any vector (cid:126)z ∈ Rm, we deﬁne

By (42), both F and G induce the same dichotomies on
(¯x, ¯r) and (˜x,(cid:126)0) respectively and thus

|sign(F¯x − ¯r)| = |sign(G˜x)| .

(43)

We deﬁne the function family

sign((cid:126)z) = (sign(z1), . . . , sign(zm)) .

H =

The set of dichotomies induced by (cid:126)r on F(cid:126)x is given by

sign(F(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r) = {sign(f(cid:126)x − (cid:126)r) | f ∈ F} .

Let ¯m be equal to the pseudo-dimension of F. This implies
that there exist two vectors ¯x ∈ X ¯m and ¯r ∈ R ¯m that are
shattered by F, i.e.,

|sign(F¯x − ¯r)| = 2 ¯m.

Since |Q|= k, this implies that there exists an injective
mapping from H to the k-fold Cartesian product of I that
generates the same dichotomies. In turn, this implies

|sign(H˜x)| ≤ |sign(I˜x)|k .

(45)

The dichotomies induced by I are generated by halfspaces
in Rd+3. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of halfspaces
in Rd+3 is bounded by d + 4 (Har-Peled, 2011) and thus
Pdim(I) ≤ d + 4. Together with Sauer’s Lemma (Sauer,

For Pdim(F) = ¯m < d + 4, the main claim holds trivially.
On the other hand, for ¯m ≥ d + 4, (47) implies that

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

Next, we prove (10). For any x ∈ Rd and Q ∈ Rd×k, we
have by the triangle inequality

d(x, Q)2 ≤ (d(x, µ) + d(µ, Q))2

= d(x, µ)2 + d(µ, Q)2 + 2 d(x, µ) d(µ, Q)

For any 0 ≤ a ≤ b, it holds that
2ab = ab + a(b− a) + a2 ≤ ab + b(b− a) + a2 = b2 + a2.

Since either 0 ≤ d(x, µ) ≤ d(µ, Q) or 0 ≤ d(µ, Q) <
d(x, µ), we thus have for any x ∈ Rd and Q ∈ Rd×k

d(x, Q)2 ≤ 2 d(x, µ)2 + 2 d(µ, Q)2.

(48)

By the same argument it also holds that for any x ∈ Rd and
Q ∈ Rd×k

d(µ, Q)2 ≤ 2 d(x, µ)2 + 2 d(x, Q)2.

(cid:2)d(x, µ)2(cid:3) < ∞, we obtain for any Q ∈ Rd×k

By taking the expectation with regards to P and noting that
σ2 = EP

d(µ, Q)2 ≤ 2σ2 + 2EP

Combining (48) and (49) implies that for any x ∈ Rd and
Q ∈ Rd×k
d(x, Q)2 ≤ 2 d(x, µ)2 + 4σ2 + 4EP
