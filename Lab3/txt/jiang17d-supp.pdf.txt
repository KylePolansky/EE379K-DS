1. Hardness of Active Search
In this section, we present the proof of Theorem 1. We
assume that active search policies have access to the correct
marginal probabilities f (x;D) = Pr(y = 1 | x,D), for
any given point x and labeled data D, which may include
“ﬁcticious” observations. Further, the computational cost
will be analyzed as the number of calls to f, i.e., f (x; D)
has unit cost. Note that the optimal policy operates in such
a computational model, with exponentially many calls (in
terms of |X|) to the marginal probability function f.
Our proof technique consists of constructing an explicit ac-
tive search instance where a small “secret” set of points S
encodes the location of a larger “hidden” group of positive
points. A particular feasibly exponential-cost policy identi-
ﬁes this small set ﬁrst, and then obtains a large reward by
collecting the revealed targets. We will show that an algo-
rithm with limited computational power (i.e., polynomial
in n = |X|) will not be able to identify the set S. As a
consequence, its performance will be arbitrarily worse than
an optimal solution as the size of the instance increases.
The crux of the proof is to construct a class of instances H
that we present next. Figure 1 shows a schematic represen-
tation of an example instance I ∈ H. The instances in H
differ from each other by a permutation of the labels. An
instance has n = |X| = 22m points, where m is a parameter
of the instance. The search budget is deﬁned to be B = m2.
The points in each instance can be categorized as follows.
“Clumps.” These points are partitioned into 2m groups,
which we will call “clumps,” each of size B. All points
in a clump share the same label. Additionally, exactly one
of the clumps comprises all positive points; the remaining
points are all negative. The clump containing the positive
points is chosen uniformly at random; therefore, the prior
marginal probability for any point xc in this category is
f (xc;∅) = pc = 2−m. We denote the clump of all positive

points C∗, where ∗ can be regarded as a m-bit integral index
1 ≤ ∗ ≤ 2m. Figure 1(b) illustrates these points.
“Isolated points.” The remaining points share the property
that observing any single one of them does not change the
marginal probabilities of any other point. These points
are illustrated in Figures 1(a) (black dots) and 1(c). The
marginal probabilities for any point xb in this category is
c = √m/2 for convenience. These points can be further
classiﬁed into two categories:

deﬁned to be f (xb;∅) = pb = 1 − c(cid:112)1/2, where we deﬁne

• A “secret set,” denoted by S; see Figure 1(a) (black
dots). These points encode which of the clumps C∗
contains the positive points, using a scheme we de-
scribe below. For ease of exposition, we partition
the set S into m subsets S1, . . . , Sm, each of size dc,
where we deﬁne d = √m. Thus |S| = mdc = m2/2 =
B/2; the size of this secret set is exactly half the budget.
The key of this construction is that each subset Si en-
codes one bit bi of information about which clump C∗
contains the positive points, using a simple encoding
scheme: the binary representation of the positive clump
C∗’s index is ∗ = b1b2 . . . bm. Each bit is encoded with
a two-step mechanism. First, each Si is partitioned into
d groups of c points, each group encoding a “meta” bit
of information bij, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ d, by a logical
OR. These meta-bits, not in the problem instance, are
illustrated by the white dots in 1(a). Finally, the meta-
bits associated with Si encode the bit bi via a logical
XOR,1 bi = bi1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ bid.

• Independent points. The remaining 22m − 2mB −
mdc points are totally independent from the others;
revealing them conveys no information for any other
point. We denote this set of points by R.

Observation 1. At least d points from Si need to be ob-
served in order to infer one bit bi of information about the
positive clump.

A virtual bit bi is computed by the XOR operation of the
d associated meta-bits bi = bi1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ bid. Notice that
each bij has same marginal probability of being positive,

meta-bits bij from the same group Si to infer the bit bi,
since observing a fraction of the inputs of an XOR does not
change the marginal belief about its outcome. So observing
d − 1 or fewer points from S conveys no information about
the positive clump. Equivalently, ∀x, Pr(y = 1 | x,D) =
Pr(y = 1 | x) if |D ∩ S| ≤ d − 1.
Observation 2. Observing any number of clump points
does not change the marginal probability of any point in the
secret set S.

We need to make sure that no external information can
help to identify the secret set S. Notice that the knowledge
of bi does not change the marginal probability of any bij;
hence, no point x in S will have a different probability after
observing bi. This means that observing points outside S
does not help distinguish S from the remaining isolated
points R.
Now we formally restate Theorem 1 and provide its proof.
The theorem implies that a polynomial time algorithm can-
not achieve a constant approximation ratio.
Theorem 1. Any (possibly randomized) policy for active

search that performs o(cid:0)n√ 1
2 log n(cid:1) inference calls f (x,D),
with |D| ≤ B, has approximation ratio with respect to the
expected utility of the optimal policy of O(cid:16) 1√log n(cid:17) where
|X| = n is the number of points, and B is the budget.2
Proof. Consider a random instance I ∈ H and ﬁx a policy
A. Let α be the total number of inference calls performed
2Note we used the little-o notation for the number of inference

calls, and the big-O notation of the approximation ratio.

by A throughout its execution. At the ith inference call
Pr(y = 1 | x,Di), A might use an arbitrary training set Di
of size at most B. We will show that A has a very small
probability of collecting a large reward on I.
Before analyzing the algorithm A, we present a lower bound
on the performance of an optimal policy. Consider the
following policy with unlimited computational power: In
the ﬁrst iteration, compute the marginal probability of an
arbitrary ﬁxed clump point, conditioning on observing every
possible subset of the isolated points of size d with labels
2 log n) inference
calls will reveal the location of the secret set S: exactly
those points will modify the probabilities of the ﬁxed clump
point. Now the policy spends the ﬁrst half of its budget
querying the points in S (recall |S| = B/2). These outcomes
reveal the hidden clump of positives C∗. The policy now
spends the second half of the budget querying (collecting)
these positive points. The expected performance of this
strategy is B/2 + pb
B/2 > B/2. Certainly this is a lower
bound on the optimal performance; hence

all equal to 1. This set of O(nd) = O(n√ 1

Now consider the algorithm A at the ith inference. By
Observations 1 and 2, A cannot differentiate between the
points in S and those in R unless |Di∩S| ≥ d. Suppose that
before the ith inference, the algorithm has no information
about S. Then the chance of A choosing a Di such that
|Di ∩ S| ≥ d is no better than that of a random selection
from n(cid:48) points, where n(cid:48) = n − 2mB is the number of
isolated points. We can upper bound the probability of A
choosing a dataset Di such that |Di ∩ S| ≥ d, by counting
how many subsets would contain at least d points from S,

If A ever hits the secret set S, for simplicity, we will assume
that it achieves maximal performance B. If A never ﬁnds
the secret set, we can further consider the following two
cases. If the algorithm queries points x ∈ R, no marginal
probabilities are changed; if a point x ∈ Cj is queried, for
any clump j, only the marginal probabilities of the clumps
are changed. The expected performance in these two cases

can be upper bounded by pretending that the algorithm had
a larger budget of size 2B; in which half the budget (i.e.,
B) is spent on querying points in R, and the other half on
querying the clump points. The expected number of targets
found after B queries on R is

Figure 2 shows the learning curves of two-step lookahead
and our method, on the ﬁrst six activity classes (of the total
120) for the ECFP4 ﬁngerprint. We can see clear patterns
indicating a transition from exploration to exploitation, es-
pecially for activity classes 1 and 2. The number of targets
found by ENS ﬁrst grows slowly, but after a certain point,

grows increasingly faster through the end of the budget. For
the two-step-lookahead myopic policy, most of the time
it behaves the opposite: it ﬁrst greedly discovers targets
faster than ENS, but in later stages, it usually levels off, not
knowing where else to go. Note the point when ENS transi-
tions from exploration to exploitation can be different for
different problems, but we see a very clear pattern when
these results are averaged over all 120 activity classes, as
shown by the difference of the two average learning curves
in Figure 3 of the main text. We also show the difference
curve for the other ﬁngerprint in Figure 3 here.

3. UCB-Style Score
We mentioned in Section 5 of the main text that we have
investigated the UCB-style (Auer, 2002) score function

α(x,D) = π + γ(cid:112)π(1 − π),

where π = Pr(y = 1 | x,D) and γ is a tradeoff parameter
between exploitation (ﬁrst term) and exploration (second
term). The results of this score varying the hyperparameter γ
are shown in Figure 4, for the CiteSeerx dataset and the drug
discovery dataset with ﬁngerprint ECFP4, using exactly the
same experimental setting as other methods (20 experiments,
same random seed for each, sample model, etc.). Note with
a ﬁxed γ, the score α is maximized at some probability
π = p∗; it is easy to derive that

by setting the derivative to zero. To better present the results,
we use p∗ ∈ [0.5, 1] as the hyper-parameterization of the
score in Figure 4. In summary, on the CiteSeerx dataset, as
shown in Figure 4(a), the performance is maximized at some
p∗ near 0.6, but there does not seem to be a clear pattern.
But when we average the performance on 2 400 experiments
on the ECFP4 data, as shown in Figure 4(c), we see that the
α score is monotonically performing better with larger p∗
(or smaller γ), and converges to the greedy policy (p∗ = 1).
