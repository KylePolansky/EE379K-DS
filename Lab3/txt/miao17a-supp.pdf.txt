Discovering Discrete Latent Topics with Neural Variational Inference

B. Topic Diversity
An issue that exists in both probabilistic and neural topic
models is redundant topics. In neural models it straight-
forward regularises the distance between each of the topic
vectors in order to diversify the topics. Following Xie et al.
(2015), we apply such topic diversity regularisation while
carrying out neural variational inference. We use the co-
sine distance to measure the distance between two topics
|ti·βj|
||ti||·||tj|| ). The mean angle of all pairs
a(ti, tj) = arccos(
of K topics is ζ = 1
j a(ti, tj), and the variance
K2
j(a(ti, tj) − m)2. We add the following
is ν = 1
K2
topic diversity regularisation to the variational objective:

J = L + λ(ζ − ν),

where λ is a hyper-parameter for the regularisation that is
empirically set as 0.1. Though in practise diversity reg-
ularisation does not provide a signiﬁcant improvement to
perplexity (2∼5 in most cases), it helps reduce topic redun-
dancy and can be easily applied on topic vectors instead of
the simplex over the full vocabulary.
