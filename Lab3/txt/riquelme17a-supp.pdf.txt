Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

Carlos Riquelme 1 Mohammad Ghavamzadeh 2 Alessandro Lazaric 3

Abstract

We explore the sequential decision-making prob-
lem where the goal is to estimate a number of lin-
ear models uniformly well, given a shared budget
of random contexts independently sampled from
a known distribution. For each incoming context,
the decision-maker selects one of the linear mod-
els and receives an observation that is corrupted
by the unknown noise level of that model. We
present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algo-
rithm that learns the models’ noise levels while
balancing contexts accordingly across them, and
prove bounds for its simple regret in both expec-
tation and high-probability. We extend the algo-
rithm and its bounds to the high dimensional set-
ting, where the number of linear models times
the dimension of the contexts is more than the
total budget of samples. Simulations with real
data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably ro-
bust, outperforming a number of baselines even
when its assumptions are violated.

1. Introduction
We study the problem faced by a decision-maker whose
goal is to estimate a number of regression problems equally
well (i.e., with a small prediction error for each of them),
and has to adaptively allocate a limited budget of samples
to the problems in order to gather information and improve
its estimates. Two aspects of the problem formulation are
key and drive the algorithm design: 1) The observations
Y collected from each regression problem depend on side
information (i.e., contexts X ∈ Rd) and we model the re-
lationship between X and Y in each problem i as a linear
function with unknown parameters βi ∈ Rd, and 2) The
“hardness” of learning each parameter βi is unknown in ad-
vance and may vary across the problems. In particular, we

assume that the observations are corrupted by noise levels
that are problem-dependent and must be learned as well.
This scenario may arise in a number of different domains
where a ﬁxed experimentation budget (number of samples)
should be allocated to different problems. Imagine a drug
company that has developed several treatments for a partic-
ular form of disease. Now it is interested in having an accu-
rate estimate of the performance of each of these treatments
for a speciﬁc population of patients (e.g., at a particular
geographical location). Given the budget allocated to this
experiment, a number of patients n can participate in the
clinical trial. Volunteered patients arrive sequentially over
time and they are represented by a context X ∈ Rd summa-
rizing their proﬁle. We model the health status of patient X
after being assigned to treatment i by scalar Yi ∈ R, which
depends on the speciﬁc drug through a linear function with
parameter βi (i.e., Yi ≈ X Tβi). The goal is to assign each
incoming patient to a treatment in such a way that at the end
of the trial, we have an accurate estimate for all βi’s. This
will allow us to reliably predict the expected health status
of each new patient X for any treatment i. Since the param-
eters βi and the noise levels are initially unknown, achiev-
ing this goal requires an adaptive allocation strategy for the
n patients. Note that while n may be relatively small, as
the ethical and ﬁnancial costs of treating a patient are high,
the distribution of the contexts X (e.g., the biomarkers of
cancer patients) can be precisely estimated in advance.
This setting is clearly related to the problem of pure ex-
ploration and active learning in multi-armed bandits (An-
tos et al., 2008), where the learner wants to estimate the
mean of a ﬁnite set of arms by allocating a ﬁnite budget
of n pulls. Antos et al. (2008) ﬁrst introduced this setting
where the objective is to minimize the largest mean square
error (MSE) in estimating the value of each arm. While
the optimal solution is trivially to allocate the pulls pro-
portionally to the variance of the arms, when the variances
are unknown an exploration-exploitation dilemma arises,
where variance and value of the arms must be estimated at
the same time in order to allocate pulls where they are more
needed (i.e., arms with high variance). Antos et al. (2008)
proposed a forcing algorithm where all arms are pulled at
n times before allocating pulls proportionally to the
least
estimated variances. They derived bounds on the regret,
measuring the difference between the MSEs of the learn-

i , the largest and the average variance,
respectively. We deﬁne a sequential decision-making prob-
lem over n rounds, where at each round t ∈ [n], the learn-
ing algorithm A receives a context Xt drawn i.i.d. from
N (0, Σ), selects an instance It, and observes a random
sample YIt,t according to (1). By the end of the experiment,
a training set Dn = {Xt, It, YIt,t}t∈[n] has been collected
and all the m linear regression problems are solved, each
problem i ∈ [m] with its own training set Di,n (i.e., a sub-
set of Dn containing samples with It = i), and estimates
of the parameters { ˆβi,n}i∈[m] are returned. For each ˆβi,n,
we measure its accuracy by the mean-squared error (MSE)

ing algorithm and an optimal allocation showing that the
regret decreases as O(n−3/2). A similar result is obtained
by Carpentier et al. (2011) that proposed two algorithms
that use upper conﬁdence bounds on the variance to es-
timate the MSE of each arm and select the arm with the
larger MSE at each step. When the arms are embedded
in Rd and their mean is a linear combination with an un-
known parameter, then the problem becomes an optimal
experimental design problem (Pukelsheim, 2006), where
the objective is to estimate the linear parameter and min-
imize the prediction error over all arms (see e.g., Wiens &
Li 2014; Sabato & Munos 2014). In this paper, we consider
an orthogonal extension to the original problem where a ﬁ-
nite number of linear regression problems is available (i.e.,
the arms) and random contexts are observed at each time
step. Similarly to the setting of Antos et al. (2008), we
assume each problem is characterized by a noise with dif-
ferent variance and the objective is to return regularized
least-squares (RLS) estimates with small prediction error
(i.e., MSE). While we leverage on the solution proposed
by Carpentier et al. (2011) to deal with the unknown vari-
ances, in our setting the presence of random contexts make
the estimation problem considerably more difﬁcult. In fact,
the MSE in one speciﬁc regression problem is not only de-
termined by the variance of the noise and the number of
samples used to compute the RLS estimate, but also by the
contexts observed over time.
Contributions. We propose TRACE-UCB, an algorithm
that simultaneously learns the “hardness” of each problem,
allocates observations proportionally to these estimates,
and balances contexts across problems. We derive perfor-
mance bounds for TRACE-UCB in expectation and high-
probability, and compare the algorithm with several base-
lines. TRACE-UCB performs remarkably well in scenarios
where the dimension of the contexts or the number of in-
stances is large compared to the total budget, motivating the
study of the high-dimensional setting, whose analysis and
performance bounds are reported in App. F of Riquelme
et al. (2017a). Finally, we provide simulations with syn-
thetic data that support our theoretical results, and with real
data that demonstrate the robustness of our approach even
when some of the assumptions do not hold.

2. Preliminaries
The problem. We consider m linear regression problems,
where each instance i ∈ [m] = {1, . . . , m} is characterized
by a parameter βi ∈ Rd such that for any context X ∈ Rd,
a random observation Y ∈ R is obtained as

Y = X Tβi + i,

(1)

where the noise i is an i.i.d. realization of a Gaussian dis-
tribution N (0, σ2
i and

i ). We denote by σ2

max = maxi σ2

Σ.

(3)

where the expectation is w.r.t. the randomness of the con-
texts Xt and observations Yi,t used to compute ˆβi,n. The
objective is to design an algorithm A that minimizes the
loss (3). This requires deﬁning an allocation rule to select
the instance It at each step t and the algorithm to com-
pute the estimates ˆβi,n, e.g., ordinary least-squares (OLS),
regularized least-squares (RLS), or Lasso. In designing a
learning algorithm, we rely on the following assumption.
Assumption 1. The covariance matrix Σ of the Gaussian
distribution generating the contexts {Xt}n

t=1 is known.

This is a standard assumption in active learning, since in
this setting the learner has access to the input distribu-
tion and the main question is for which context she should
ask for a label (Sabato & Munos, 2014; Riquelme et al.,
2017b). Often times, companies, like the drug company
considered in the introduction, own enough data to have
an accurate estimate of the distribution of their customers
(patients).
While in the rest of the paper we focus on Ln(A), our al-
gorithm and analysis can be easily extended to similar ob-
jectives such as replacing the maximum in (3) with average

across all instances, i.e., 1/m(cid:80)m

EDn
using weighted errors, i.e., maxi wi EDn
updating the score to focus on the estimated standard de-
viation and by including the weights in the score, respec-
tively. Later in the paper, we also consider the case where
the expectation in (3) is replaced by the high-probability
error (see Eq. 17).
Optimal static allocation with OLS estimates. While the
distribution of the contexts is ﬁxed and does not depend on
the instance i, the errors Li,n( ˆβi,n) directly depend on the
variances σ2
i of the noise i. We deﬁne an optimal baseline

(cid:2)Li,n( ˆβi,n)(cid:3), and
(cid:2)Li,n( ˆβi,n)(cid:3), by

obtained when the noise variances {σ2
i=1 are known. In
particular, we focus on a static allocation algorithm Astat
that selects each instance i exactly ki,n times, indepen-
dently of the context,1 and returns an estimate ˆβi,n com-

Proof. See Appendix A.1.2

Proposition 1 divides the problems into two types: those
i ≥ ¯σ2 (wild instances) and those for which
for which σ2

σ2
the second term in (7) is negative and the instance should
be selected less frequently than in the context-free case
(where the optimal allocation is given just by the ﬁrst term).
On the other hand, instances whose variance is below the

mean variance should be pulled more often. In any case,
we see that the correction to the context-free allocation
(i.e., the second term) is constant, as it does not depend on
n. Nonetheless, it does depend on d and this suggests that
in high-dimensional problems, it may signiﬁcantly skew
the optimal allocation.
While A∗
stat effectively minimizes the prediction loss Ln,
it cannot be implemented in practice since the optimal al-
location k∗

beginning of the experiment. As a result, we need to devise
a learning algorithm A whose performance approaches L∗

n,

Rn(A) = Ln(A) − Ln(A∗

(9)
and we expect Rn(A) = o(1/n). In fact, any allocation
strategy that selects each instance a linear number of times
(e.g., uniform sampling) achieves a loss Ln = O(1/n), and
thus, a regret of order O(1/n). However, we expect that the
loss of an effective learning algorithm decreases not just at
the same rate as L∗
n but also with the very same constant,
thus implying a regret that decreases faster than O(1/n).

3. The TRACE-UCB Algorithm
In this section, we present and analyze an algorithm of
the form discussed at the end of Section 2, which we
call TRACE-UCB, whose pseudocode is in Algorithm 1.

Intuition. Equation (6) suggests that while the parameters
of the context distribution, particularly its covariance Σ, do

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

not impact the prediction error, the noise variances play the
most important role in the loss of each problem instance.
This is in fact conﬁrmed by the optimal allocation k∗
i,n
in (7), where only the variances σ2
i appear. This evidence
suggests that an algorithm similar to GAFS-MAX (Antos
et al., 2008) or CH-AS (Carpentier et al., 2011), which
were designed for the context-free case (i.e., each instance i
is associated to an expected value and not a linear function)
would be effective in this setting as well. Nonetheless, (6)
holds only for static allocation algorithms that completely
ignore the context and the history to decide which instance
It to choose at time t. On the other hand, adaptive learning
algorithms create a strong correlation between the dataset
Dt−1 collected so far, the current context Xt, and the deci-
sion It. As a result, the sample matrix Xi,t is no longer a
random variable independent of A, and using (6) to design
a learning algorithm is not convenient, since the impact of
the contexts on the error is completely overlooked. Unfor-
tunately, in general, it is very difﬁcult to study the potential
correlation between the contexts Xi,t, the intermediate es-
timates ˆβi,t, and the most suitable choice It. However, in
the next lemma, we show that if at each step t, we select It
as a function of Dt−1, and not Xt, we may still recover an
expression for the ﬁnal loss that we can use as a basis for
the construction of an effective learning algorithm.
Lemma 2. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects
the instances It as a function of the previous history,
and computes estimates(cid:98)βi,n using OLS. Then, its loss after
i.e., Dt−1 = {X1, I1, YI1,1, . . . , Xt−1, It−1, YIt−1,t−1}

timates of the parameter (cid:98)βi,t and variance(cid:98)σ2

Remark 1 (assumptions). We assume noise and contexts
are Gaussian. The noise Gaussianity is crucial for the es-
i,t to be inde-
pendent of each other, for each instance i and time t (we
actually need and derive a stronger result in Lemma 9, see
Appendix B). This is key in proving Lemma 2, as it allows
us to derive a closed form expression for the loss function
which holds under our algorithm, and is written in terms of
the number of pulls and the trace of the inverse empirical

covariance matrix. Note that(cid:98)βi,t drives our loss, while(cid:98)σ2

i,t
drives our decisions. One way to remove this assumption is
by deﬁning and directly optimizing a surrogate loss equal
to (10) instead of (3). On the other hand, the Gaussianity of
contexts leads to the whitened inverse covariance estimate
i,n being distributed as an inverse Wishart. As there

Σ(cid:98)Σ−1

is a convenient closed formula for its mean, we can ﬁnd
the exact optimal static allocation k∗
i,n in Proposition 1, see
(7). In general, for sub-Gaussian contexts, no such closed
formula for the trace is available. However, as long as the
optimal allocation k∗
i,n has no second order nα terms for
1/2 ≤ α < 1, it is possible to derive the same regret rate
results that we prove later on for TRACE-UCB.
Equation (10) makes it explicit that the prediction error
comes from two different sources. The ﬁrst one is the noise
in the measurements Y, whose impact is controlled by the
unknown variances σ2
i is, the
more observations are required to achieve the desired ac-
curacy. At the same time, the diversity of contexts across
instances also impacts the overall prediction error. This is
very intuitive, since it would be a terrible idea for the re-
search center discussed in the introduction to estimate the
parameters of a drug by providing the treatment only to a
hundred almost identical patients. We say contexts are bal-

anced when (cid:98)Σi,n is well conditioned. Therefore, a good

i ’s. Clearly, the larger the σ2

algorithm should take care of both aspects.
There are two extreme scenarios regarding the contribu-
tions of the two sources of error. 1) If the number of
contexts n is relatively large, since the context distribu-
tion is ﬁxed, one can expect that contexts allocated to each
instance eventually become balanced (i.e., TRACE-UCB
does not bias the distribution of the contexts). In this case,
it is the difference in σ2
i ’s that drives the number of times
each instance is selected. 2) When the dimension d or the
number of arms m is large w.r.t. n, balancing contexts be-
comes critical, and can play an important role in the ﬁnal
prediction error, whereas the σ2
i ’s are less relevant in this
scenario. While a learning algorithm cannot deliberately
choose a speciﬁc context (i.e., Xt is a random variable),
we may need to favor instances in which the contexts are
poorly balanced and their prediction error is large, despite
the fact that they might have small noise variances.
Algorithm. TRACE-UCB is designed as a combination of
the upper-conﬁdence-bound strategy used in CH-AS (Car-
pentier et al., 2011) and the loss in (10), so as to obtain a
learning algorithm capable of allocating according to the
estimated variances and at the same time balancing the er-
ror generated by context mismatch. We recall that all the
quantities that are computed at every step of the algorithm
are indexed at the beginning and end of a step t by i, t − 1

(e.g.,(cid:98)σ2
(cid:98)βi,t, and then use it to estimate the variance(cid:98)σ2

(cid:98)σ2

each step t, TRACE-UCB ﬁrst computes an OLS estimate

i,t as

i,t =

which is the average squared deviation of the predictions

based on (cid:98)βi,t. We rely on the following concentration in-

and then simply select the instance which maximizes this
score, i.e., It = arg maxi si,t−1. Intuitively, TRACE-UCB
favors problems where the prediction error is potentially
large, either because of a large noise variance or because
of signiﬁcant unbalance in the observed contexts w.r.t. the
target distribution with covariance Σ. A subtle but critical
aspect of TRACE-UCB is that by ignoring the current con-
text Xt (but using all the past samples Xt−1) when choos-
ing It, the distribution of the contexts allocated to each in-
stance stays untouched and the second term in the score
i,t−1), naturally tends to d as more and
more (random) contexts are allocated to instance i. This is
shown by Proposition 4 whose proof is in Appendix C.2.

Eq. (15) shows that the regret decreases as O(n−3/2) as ex-
pected. This is consistent with the context-free results (An-
tos et al., 2008; Carpentier et al., 2011), where the regret
decreases as n−3/2, which is conjectured to be optimal.
However, it is important to note that in the contextual case,
the numerator also includes the dimensionality d. Thus,
when n (cid:29) d, the regret will be small, and it will be larger
when n ≈ d. This motivates studying the high-dimensional
setting (App. F). Eq. (15) also indicates that the regret
depends on a problem-dependent constant 1/λmin, which
measures the complexity of the problem. Note that when
max ≈ σ2
min, we have 1/λmin ≈ m, but 1/λmin could be

much larger when σ2

The only difference with the score used by TRACE-UCB
is the lack of the trace term in (12). Moreover, the regret
of this algorithm has similar rate in terms of n and d as
that of TRACE-UCB reported in Theorem 6. However, the
simulations of Sect. 4 show that the regret of VAR-UCB is
actually much higher than that of TRACE-UCB, specially
when dm is close to n. Intuitively, when n is close to dm,
balancing contexts becomes critical, and VAR-UCB suffers
because its score does not explicitly take them into account.
Sketch of the proof of Theorem 6. The proof is divided
into three parts. 1) We show that the behavior of the ridge

3Note that VAR-UCB is similar to both the CH-AS and B-AS

algorithms in Carpentier et al. (2011).

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

loss of TRACE-UCB is similar to that reported in Lemma 2
for algorithms that rely on OLS; see Lemma 19 in Ap-
pendix E. The independence of the ˆβi,t and ˆσ2
i,t estimates
is again essential (see Remark 1). Although the loss of
TRACE-UCB depends on the ridge estimate of the param-
eters ˆβλ
i,n, the decisions made by the algorithm at each
i,t and ob-
round only depend on the variance estimates ˆσ2
served contexts. 2) We follow the ideas in Carpentier et al.
(2011) to lower-bound the total number of pulls ki,n for
each i ∈ [m] under a good event (see Theorem 5 and its
proof in Appendix D.1). 3) We ﬁnally use the ridge reg-
ularization to bound the impact of those cases outside the
good event, and combine everything in Appendix D.2.
The regret bound of Theorem 6 shows that the largest
expected loss across the problem instances incurred by
TRACE-UCB quickly approaches the loss of the optimal
static allocation algorithm (which knows the true noise
variances). While Ln(A) measures the worst expected loss,
at any speciﬁc realization of the algorithm, there may be
one of the instances which is very poorly estimated. As a
result, it would also be desirable to obtain guarantees for
the (random) maximum loss

In particular, we are able to prove the following high-

Note that the ﬁrst term in (18) corresponds to the ﬁrst term
of the loss for the optimal static allocation, and the second
term is, again, a n−3/2 deviation. However, in this case, the
guarantees hold simultaneously for all the instances.
Sketch of the proof of Theorem 7. In the proof we slightly
modify the conﬁdence ellipsoids for the ˆβi,t’s, based
on self-normalized martingales, and derived in (Abbasi-
Yadkori et al., 2011); see Thm. 13 in App. C. By means of
the conﬁdence ellipsoids we control the loss in (17). Their
radiuses depend on the number of samples per instance, and
we rely on a high-probability events to compute a lower
bound on the number of samples. In addition, we need to
make sure the mean norm of the contexts will not be too
large (see Corollary 15 in App. C). Finally, we combine the
lower bound on ki,n with the conﬁdence ellipsoids to con-
clude the desired high-probability guarantees in Thm. 7.
High-Dimensional Setting. High-dimensional linear mod-
els are quite common in practice, motivating the study of
the n < dm case, where the algorithms discussed so far

break down. We propose SPARSE-TRACE-UCB in Ap-
pendix F, an extension of TRACE-UCB that assumes and
takes advantage of joint sparsity across the linear functions.
The algorithm has two-stages: ﬁrst, an approximate sup-
port is recovered, and then, TRACE-UCB is applied to the
induced lower dimensional space. We discuss and extend
our high-probability guarantees to SPARSE-TRACE-UCB
under suitable standard assumptions in Appendix F.

4. Simulations
In this section, we provide empirical evidence to support
our theoretical results. We consider both synthetic and real-
world problems, and compare the performance (in terms of
normalized MSE) of TRACE-UCB to uniform sampling,
optimal static allocation (which requires the knowledge of
noise variances), and the context-free algorithm VAR-UCB
(see Remark 2). We do not compare to GFSP-MAX and
GAFS-MAX (Antos et al., 2008) since they are outper-
formed by CH-AS Carpentier et al. (2011) and VAR-UCB
is the same as CH-AS, except for the fact that we use the
concentration inequality in Prop. 3, since we are estimating
the variance from a regression problem using OLS.
First, we use synthetic data to ensure that all the assump-
tions of our model are satisﬁed, namely we deal with lin-
ear regression models with Gaussian context and noise.
We set the number of problem instances to m = 7 and
consider two scenarios: one in which all the noise vari-
ances are equal to 1 and one where they are not equal,
and σ2 = (0.01, 0.02, 0.75, 1, 2, 2, 3). In the latter case,
min = 300. We study the impact of (independently)
σ2
max/σ2
increasing dimension d and horizon n on the performance,
while keeping all other parameters ﬁxed. Second, we con-
sider real-world datasets in which the underlying model is
non-linear and the contexts are not Gaussian, to observe
how TRACE-UCB behaves (relative to the baselines) in set-
tings where its main underlying assumptions are violated.
Synthetic Data. In Figures 1(a,b), we display the results
for ﬁxed horizon n = 350 and increasing dimension d.
For each value of d, we run 10, 000 simulations and report
the median of the maximum error across the instances for
each simulation. In Fig. 1(a), where σ2
i ’s are equal, uniform
sampling and optimal static allocation execute the same al-
location since there is no difference in the expected losses
of different instances. Nonetheless we notice that VAR-
UCB suffers from poor estimation as soon as d increases,
while TRACE-UCB is competitive with the optimal perfor-
mance. This difference in performance can be explained
by the fact that VAR-UCB does not control for contextual
balance, which becomes a dominant factor in the loss of a
learning strategy for problems of high dimensionality. In
Fig. 1(b), in which σ2
i ’s are different, uniform sampling is
no longer optimal but even in this case VAR-UCB performs

better than uniform sampling only for small d < 23, where
it is more important to control for the σ2
i ’s. For larger di-
mensions, balancing uniformly the contexts eventually be-
comes a better strategy, and uniform sampling outperforms
VAR-UCB. In this case too, TRACE-UCB is competitive
with the optimal static allocation even for large d, success-
fully balancing both noise variance and contextual error.
Next, we study the performance of the algorithms w.r.t. n.
We report two different losses, one in expectation (3) and
one in high probability (17), corresponding to the results
we proved in Theorems 6 and 7, respectively. In order to
approximate the loss in (3) (Figures 1(c,d)) we run 30, 000
simulations, compute the average prediction error for each
instance i ∈ [m], and ﬁnally report the maximum mean er-
ror across the instances. On the other hand, we estimate the
loss in (17) (Figures 1(e,f)) by running 30, 000 simulations,
taking the maximum prediction error across the instances
for each simulation, and ﬁnally reporting their median.
In Figures 1(c, d), we display the loss for ﬁxed dimension
d = 10 and horizon from n = 115 to 360. In Figure 1(c),
TRACE-UCB performs similarly to the optimal static al-
location, whereas VAR-UCB performs signiﬁcantly worse,

ranging from 25% to 50% higher errors than TRACE-UCB,
due to some catastrophic errors arising from unlucky con-
textual realizations for an instance. In Fig. 1(d), as the num-
ber of contexts grows, uniform sampling’s simple context

both ﬁgures, TRACE-UCB smoothly learns the σ2
i ’s and
outperforms uniform sampling and VAR-UCB. Its perfor-
mance is comparable to that of the optimal static allocation,
especially in the case of equal variances in Fig. 1(c).
In Figure 1(e), TRACE-UCB learns and properly balances
observations extremely fast and obtains an almost optimal
performance. Similarly to ﬁgures 1(a,c), VAR-UCB strug-
gles when variances ˆσ2
i are almost equal, mainly because it
gets confused by random deviations in variance estimates
i , while overlooking potential and harmful context imbal-
ˆσ2
ances. Note that even when n = 360 (rightmost point), its
median error is still 25% higher than TRACE-UCB’s. In
Fig. 1(f), as expected, uniform sampling performs poorly,
due to mismatch in variances, and only outperforms VAR-
UCB for small horizons in which uniform allocation pays
off. On the other hand, TRACE-UCB is able to success-

that for large n, VAR-UCB eventually reaches the perfor-
mance of the optimal static allocation and TRACE-UCB.
In practice the loss in (17) (ﬁgures 1(e,f)) is often more rel-
evant than (3), since it is in high probability and not in ex-
pectation, and TRACE-UCB shows excellent performance
and robustness, regardless of the underlying variances σ2
i .
Real Data. TRACE-UCB is based on assumptions such as
linearity, and Gaussianity of noise and context that may not
hold in practice, where data may show complex dependen-
cies. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the algorithm
with real-world data to see its robustness to the violation
of its assumptions. We consider two collaborative ﬁlter-
ing datasets in which users provide ratings for items. We
choose a dense subset of k users and p items, where every
user has rated every item. Thus, each user is represented
by a p-dimensional vector of ratings. We deﬁne the user
context by d out of her p ratings, and learn to predict her
remaining m = p − d ratings (each one is a problem in-
stance). All item ratings are ﬁrst centered, so each item’s
mean is zero. In each simulation, n out of the k users are se-
lected at random to be fed to the algorithm, also in random
order. Algorithms can select any instance as the dataset
contains the ratings of every instance for all the users. At
the end of each simulation, we compute the prediction error
for each instance by using the k − n users that did not par-
ticipate in training for that simulation. Finally, we report
the median error across all simulations.
Fig. 2(a) reports the results using the Jester Dataset
by (Goldberg et al., 2001) that consists of joke ratings in
a continuous scale from −10 to 10. We take d = 40 joke
ratings as context and learn the ratings for another 9 jokes.
In addition, we add another function that counts the total
number of movies originally rated by the user. The latter
is also centered, bounded to the same scale, and has higher
variance (without conditioning on X). The number of to-

tal users is k = 3811, and m = 10. When the number
of observations is limited, the advantage of TRACE-UCB
is quite signiﬁcant (the improvement w.r.t. uniform alloca-
tion goes from 45% to almost 20% for large n, while w.r.t.
VAR-UCB it goes from almost 30% to roughly 5%), even
though the model and context distribution are far from lin-
ear and Gaussian, respectively.

dataset (Maxwell Harper & Konstan, 2016) that con-

We select 30 popular movies rated by k = 1363 users,
and randomly choose m = 5 of them to learn (so
d = 25). In this case, all problems have similar variance
min ≈ 1.3) so uniform allocation seems appropri-
(ˆσ2

uniform allocation, while their performance is similar.

We studied the problem of adaptive allocation of n con-
textual samples of dimension d to estimate m linear func-

that depend on the linear instance and are unknown to
the decision-maker. We proposed TRACE-UCB, an opti-
mistic algorithm that successfully solves the exploration-
exploitation dilemma by simultaneously learning the σ2
i ’s,
allocating samples accordingly to their estimates, and bal-
ancing the contextual information across the instances. We
also provide strong theoretical guarantees for two losses of
interest: in expectation and high-probability. Simulations
were conducted in several settings, with both synthetic and
real data. The favorable results suggest that TRACE-UCB
is reliable, and remarkably robust even in settings that fall
outside its assumptions, thus, a useful and simple tool to
implement in practice.

B. Loss of an OLS-based Learning Algorithm (Proof of Lemma 2)
Unlike in the proof of Proposition 1, when the number of pulls is random and depends on the value of the previous
for Astat no longer holds.
In fact, for a learning algorithm, the value ki,t itself provides some information about the
observations that have been obtained up until time t and were used by the algorithm to determine ki,t. In the following, we
show that by ignoring the current context Xt when choosing instance It, we are still able to analyze the loss of TRACE-
UCB and obtain a result very similar to the static case.
We ﬁrst need two auxiliary lemmas (Lemmas 8 and 9), one on the computation of an empirical estimate of the variance of
the noise, and an independence result between the variance estimate and the linear regression estimate.

V = ˆβt+1 − β | Gt.

We want to show that the random vectors U ∈ R and V ∈ Rd are independent. We ﬁrst recall that the noise t+1 | Gt ∼
N (0, σ2), and it is independent of 1, . . . , t, and ˆβt under Gt. Furthermore, by the induction assumption ˆβt | Gt is also
Gaussian, so we have that ( ˆβt, t+1) are jointly Gaussian given Gt. Then we can conveniently rewrite U as

where we applied the Woodbury matrix identity in the last step. Finally, it follows that

and the induction is complete.

Now we can prove Lemma 2:
Lemma. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects instances It as a function of the previous history, that is, Dt−1 =

{X1, I1, YI1,1, . . . , Xt−1, It−1, YIt−1,t−1} and computes estimates (cid:98)βi,n using OLS. Then, its loss after n steps can be

Proof. For any instance i, we can assume that the following random variables are sampled before TRACE-UCB starts
collecting observations (we omit the i index in the table):

As a result, we can interpret TRACE-UCB as controlling the stopping time ti = ki,n for each problem i, that is, the total
number of samples ki,n, leading to the ﬁnal estimates ˆβti and ˆσ2
ti. In the following we introduce the notation X1:j as the
sample matrix constructed from exactly j samples, unlike Xi,n which is the sample matrix obtained with ki,n. So we have
j | X1:j are independent for any ﬁxed j
X1:ki,n = Xi,n. Crucially, when the errors j are Gaussian, then ˆβj | X1:j and ˆσ2
(note these random variables have nothing to do with the algorithm’s decisions).
Let Fj be the σ-algebra generated by X1, . . . , Xn and ˆσ2

j . We recall that from Lemma 9

1, . . . , ˆσ2

(cid:98)βj|X1:j = ˆβj | Fj ∼ N (βj, σ2 (X T

1:jX1:j)−1).

(31)
Intuitively, this results says that, given the data X1:n, if we are additionally given all the estimates for the variance {ˆσ2
s}j
s=2
—which obviously depend on 1, . . . , j—, then the updated distribution for ˆβj does not change at all. This is a crucial
property since TRACE-UCB ignores the current context Xt and it makes decisions only based on previous contexts and
the variance estimates {ˆσ2
s}j

s=2, thus allowing us to proceed and do inference on ˆβj as in the ﬁxed allocation case.

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

We now need to take into consideration the ﬁltration Fi,j for a speciﬁc instance i and the environment ﬁltration E−i
containing all the contexts X and noise  from all other instances (different from i). Since the environment ﬁltration E−i is
independent from the samples from instance i, then we can still apply Lemma 9 and obtain

(cid:98)βi,j | Fi,j,E−i ∼ (cid:98)βi,j | Fi,j.

result for the(cid:98)β estimates, and a concentration inequality for the norm of the observations Xt.

C.1. Concentration Inequality for the Variance (Proof of Proposition 3)

Also note that the distribution of the estimate does not depend on Xt and we can integrate out the randomness in Xt. In

order to show concentration around the mean, we directly use the sub-exponential properties of ˆσ2

exponential. As a result, we have that ˆσ2

Now we use Proposition 10 as our concentration bound. In our case, η2/τ 2 < η/b, when η < σ2. In such a case, if we
denote the RHS of (34) by δ, we conclude that

C.2. Concentration Inequality for the Trace (Proof of Proposition 4)
We ﬁrst recall some basic deﬁnitions. For any matrix A ∈ Rn×d, the i-th singular value si(A) is equivalent to si(A)2 =
λi(ATA), where λi is the i-th eigenvalue. The smallest and largest singular values smin and smax satisfy

smin (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)Ax(cid:107)2 ≤ smax (cid:107)x(cid:107)2

for all x ∈ Rd.

The extreme singular values measure the maximum and minimum distortion of points and their distance when going from
Rd to Rn via the linear operator A. We also recall that the spectral norm of A is given by

(cid:107)A(cid:107) = sup
x∈Rd\0

(cid:107)Ax(cid:107)2
(cid:107)x(cid:107)2

= sup

(cid:107)Ax(cid:107)2,

x∈Sn−1
and thus, smax(A) = (cid:107)A(cid:107) and smin(A) = 1/(cid:107)A−1(cid:107), if A is invertible.
We report the following concentration inequality for the eigenvalues of random Gaussian matrices.

Note that (cid:101)Ln(A) is a random variable as ˆβi,n is random, and the expectation is only taken with respect to the test point

X ∼ F (leading to the Σ-norm). We expect results of the following ﬂavor: let δ > 0, then with probability at least 1 − δ,

Proof. We deﬁne a set of events that help us control the loss, and then we show that these events simultaneously hold with
high probability. In particular, we need the following events:

1. EG ≡ the good event holds (for all arms i, and all times t), which includes a conﬁdence interval for ˆσ2

of the empirical covariance matrix.
Holds with probability 1 − δG. This event is described and controlled in Proposition 3 and Proposition 4.

i,t and the trace

2. EM,i ≡ the conﬁdence intervals Ci,t created for arm i at time t contain the true βi at all times t —based on the

vector-valued martingale in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011).
Holds with probability 1 − δM,i. This event is described and controlled in Theorem 13.

3. EC,i,t ≡ the empirical covariance ˆΣi,t for arm i at time t is close to Σ. This event is a direct consequence of event EG.
4. EB,i,t ≡ the ﬁrst t observations pulled at arm i have norm reasonably bounded. The empirical average norm is not too

far from its mean. Holds with probability 1 − δB,i,t. This event is described and controlled in Corollary 15.

Let H be the set of all the previous events. Then, by the union bound

P (∩∈H ) ≥ 1 −(cid:88)

∈H

that resembles the expected loss of the algorithm that knows the σ2

Our goal is to show that if ∩∈H  holds, then the loss (cid:101)Ln(A) = maxi∈[m] (cid:107)βi − ˆβi,n(cid:107)2
Fix δ > 0. We want δ =(cid:80)
Also, (cid:80)
(cid:80)

∈H δ, and we would like to assign equal weight to all the sets of events. First, δG = δ/3.
i δM,i = δ/3, implying δM,i = δ/3m for every arm i ∈ [m]. Finally, to bound observation norms, we set
t δB,i,t = δ/3. It follows that we can take δB,i,t = δ/3mT , even though t really ranges from d to n.

Σ is upper bounded by a quantity

Assume that EG,EM,i and EB,i,t hold for all arms i and times t. Then, by Theorem 5, the ﬁnal number of pulls for arm i
can be lower bounded by

For notational simplicity, we denote by ˆβi,t the estimate after t pulls. Thus, with respect to our previous notation where
ˆβi,n referred to our ﬁnal estimate, we have that ˆβi,ki,n = ˆβi,n as ki,n is the total number of pulls for arm i.
If the EM,i events hold, then we know that our ˆβi,t estimates are not very far from the true values βi when t is large. In
particular, we know that the error is controlled by the radius Ri,t of the conﬁdence ellipsoids. We expect these radiuses to
decrease with the number of observations per arm, t. As we have a lower bound on the total number of pulls for arm i, ki,n,
if the conﬁdence ellipsoids apply, then we can directly obtain an upper bound on the radius Ri,t at the end of the process.
We need to do a bit of work to properly bound (cid:107) ˆβi,ki,n − βi(cid:107)2
Σ.
Fix arm i, and assume EM,i holds. In addition, assume (cid:107)βi(cid:107)2 ≤ Z for all i. Let ¯Vi,t = λI + XT
i,tXi,t, where Xi,t contains
the ﬁrst t observations pulled by arm i. We modify the proof of Theorem 2 in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) by taking
x = ( ˆVt/t)( ˆβt − β∗) in their equation 5 (we are using their notation in the latter expression). Assume the algorithm pulls
arm i a total of t times —ki,n is a stopping time with respect to the σ-algebra that includes the environment (other arms)—

as the regularization is washed out. The distance between ˆΣi,t = ¯Vi,t/t − (λ/t)I and Σ is captured by event C,i,t.
Formally, as EG holds, we know that the difference between Σ and ˆΣi,t is bounded in operator norm for any i and t by

E. Loss of a RLS-based Learning Algorithm
E.1. Distribution of RLS estimates
Proposition 16. Given a linear regression problem with observations Y = X Tβ +  with Gaussian noise with variance
σ2, after n contexts X and the corresponding observations Y, the ridge estimate of parameter λ is obtained as

with W = (XTX + λI)−1, and its distribution conditioned on X is

ˆβλ = (XTX + λI)−1XTY = WXTY,

ˆβλ | X ∼ N(cid:0)β − λWβ, σ2 W(XTX)WT(cid:1) .

Proof. Recalling the deﬁnition of the OLS estimator(cid:98)β (assuming it exists), we can easily rewrite the RLS estimator as
This immediately gives that the conditional distribution of ˆβλ is Gaussian as for (cid:98)β. We just need to compute the corre-

ˆβλ = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)(XTX)−1XTY = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)(cid:98)β.

sponding mean vector and the covariance matrix. We ﬁrst notice that the RLS estimator is biased as

(95)

Let S = XTX, then we can further rewrite the bias as

E[ ˆβλ(cid:12)(cid:12)X] = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)β.
S(cid:0)I + λS−1(cid:1)(cid:17)−1
= (I + λS−1)−1β =(cid:0)I − λ(S + λI)−1(cid:1)β

E[ ˆβλ(cid:12)(cid:12)X] = (S + λSS−1)−1Sβ =

(cid:16)

where we used the matrix inversion lemma. Recalling that the covariance of(cid:98)β is σ2(XTX)−1, the covariance of(cid:98)βλ is then

Plugging the ﬁnal expression back into Ln(Astatic) we obtain the desired expression.

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

We notice that a result similar to Lemma 9 holds for RLS estimates as well.
Proposition 18. Assume the noise  is Gaussian. Let ˆσ2 be the estimate for σ2 computed by using the residuals of the OLS
solution ˆβ. Then, ˆβλ and ˆσ2 are independent random variable conditionally to X.

Proof. As shown in the proof of Proposition 16, we have ˆβλ = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)(cid:98)β and we know that functions of
independent random variables are themselves independent. Since the matrix mapping(cid:98)β to(cid:98)βλ is ﬁxed given X, and ˆβ and

ˆσ2 are conditionally independent from Lemma 9, then the statement follows.

We can now combine Proposition 18 and Lemma 17 to conclude that a similar expression to Eq. 97 holds for the ridge
estimators also when a non-static algorithm such as TRACE-UCB is run.
Lemma 19. Let A be a learning algorithm such that

Then, we proceed in a way similar to that in the proof of Lemma 2 to perform the required conditioning.

F. Sparse Trace-UCB Algorithm
F.1. Summary

High-dimensional linear regression models are remarkably common in practice. Companies tend to record a large number
of features of their customers, and feed them to their prediction models. There are also cases in which the number of prob-
lem instances under consideration m is large, e.g., too many courses in the MOOC example described in the introduction.
Unless the horizon n is still proportionally large w.r.t. md, these scenarios require special attention. In particular, algo-
rithms like TRACE-UCB that adaptively use contexts in their allocation strategy become more robust than their context-free
counterparts.
A natural assumption in such scenarios is sparsity, i.e., only a small subset of features are relevant to the prediction
problem at hand (have non-zero coefﬁcient). In our setting of m problem instances, it is often reasonable to assume that
these instances are related to each other, and thus, it makes sense to extend the concept of sparsity to joint sparsity, i.e., a
sparsity pattern across the instances. Formally, we assume that there exists a s (cid:28) d such that

|S| ∆= | ∪i∈[m] supp(βi)| = s,

i

(98)
(cid:54)= 0} denotes the support of the i’th problem instance. A special case of joint sparsity is

where supp(βi) = {j ∈ [d] : β(j)
when |supp(βi)| ≈ s, for all i, i.e., most of the relevant features are shared across the instances.
In this section, we focus on the scenario where dm > n. When we can only allocate a small (relative to d) number of
contexts to each problem instance, proper balancing of contexts becomes extremely important, and thus, the algorithms
that do not take into account context in their allocation are destined to fail. Although TRACE-UCB has the advantage of
using context in its allocation strategy, it still needs to quickly discover the relevant features (those in the support) and only
use those in its allocation strategy.
This motivates a two-stage algorithm, we call it SPARSE-TRACE-UCB, whose pseudocode is in Algorithm 2. In the ﬁrst
stage, the algorithm allocates contexts uniformly to all the instances, L contexts per instance, and then recovers the support.

In the second stage, it relies on the discovered support (cid:98)S, and applies the standard TRACE-UCB to all the instances, but
only takes into account the features in (cid:98)S. Note that L should be large enough that with high probability, support is exactly
discovered, i.e., (cid:98)S = S.

There exists a large literature on how to perform simultaneous support discovery in jointly sparse linear regression prob-
lems (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011; Obozinski et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013), which we discuss in detail below.
Most of these algorithms minimize the regularized empirical loss

where k is the number of samples per problem, M be the matrix whose i’th column is M[, i] = ˆβi, Xi ∈ Rk×d, and
Yi = Xiβi + i. In particular, they use la/lb block regularization norm, i.e., (cid:107)M(cid:107)la/lb = (cid:107)v(cid:107)la, where vi = (cid:107)M[i, ](cid:107)lb
and M[i, ] is the i’th row of M. In short, the SPARSE-TRACE-UCB algorithm uses the l1/l2 block regularization Lasso
algorithm (Wang et al., 2013), an extension of the algorithm in (Obozinski et al., 2011), for its support discovery stage.
We extend the guarantees of Theorem 7 to the high dimensional case with joint sparsity, assuming s is known.
The following is the main result of this section:
Theorem 20. Let δ1 > 0. Assume (cid:107)βi(cid:107)2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi, Σ) satisfy

The exact technical assumptions and the proof are given and discussed in below. We simply combine the high-probability
results of Theorem 7, and the high-probability support recovery of Theorem 2 in (Wang et al., 2013).
In addition, we provide Corollary 21, where we study the regime of interest where the support overlap is complete (for
simplicity), n = C1 ms log d (cid:28) md for C1 > 0, and L = C2 s log d, for C1 − C2 > 0.
Corollary 21. Under the assumptions of Theorem 20, let δ1 > 0, assume n = C1 ms log d, the support of all arms are
equal, and set L = C2 s log d, for ¯C := C1 − C2 > 0. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ1 − δ2,

Given our pure exploration perspective, it is obviously more efﬁcient to learn the true supports as soon as possible. That
way we can adjust our behavior by collecting the right data based on our initial ﬁndings. Note that this is not always the
case; for example, if the total number of pulls is unknown. Then it is not clear what is the right amount of budget to invest
upfront to recover the supports (see tracking algorithms and doubling trick).
We brieﬂy describe Algorithm 2 in words. First, in the recovery stage we sequentially pull all arms a number of times,
say L times. We do not take into account the context, and just apply a round robin technique to pull each arm exactly L
times. In total, there are exactly s components that are non-zero for at least one arm (out of d). After the Lm pulls, we
use a block-regularized Lasso algorithm to recover the joint sparsity pattern. We discuss some of the alternatives later. The

outcome of this stage is a common support(cid:98)S := ∪i supp( ˆβi). With high probability we recover the true support(cid:98)S = S. In

the second stage, or pure exploration stage, the original TRACE-UCB algorithm is applied. The TRACE-UCB algorithm
works by computing an estimate ˆσ2

i at each step t for each arm i. Then, it pulls the arm maximizing the score

The key observation is that in the second stage we only consider the components of each context that are in(cid:98)S. In particular,
those estimates when an arm is pulled, and the trace is computed with respect to the components in (cid:98)S only.

we start by pulling s + 1 times each arm so that we can compute the initial OLS estimates ˆβOLS

What is the optimal static performance in this setting if the σ2’s are known? For simplicity, suppose we pull arm i exactly
2. Note in this case we can actually set λi

A common guarantee is as follows (see (Hastie et al., 2015; Raskutti et al., 2010)). With high probability

Note that the latter event is independent across different i ∈ [m], so all of them simultaneously hold with high probability.
The term γ−2 was expected as depending on the correlation levels in Σ the problem can be easier or harder. In addition,
note that as (cid:107) ˆβi − βi(cid:107)2

Σ = Tr(Σ( ˆβi − βi)( ˆβi − βi)T ), we have that

F.3. Simultaneous Support Recovery

There has been a large amount of research on how to perform simultaneous support recovery in sparse settings for multiple
regressions. Let M be the matrix whose i-th column is M(i) = βi.
A common objective function after k observations per problem is

(cid:107)Yj − Xj ¯M(j)(cid:107)2 + λ (cid:107) ¯M(cid:107),

The la/lb block regularization norm is

¯Mj is the j-th row of ¯M.

(cid:107) ¯M(cid:107)la/lb = (cid:107)v(cid:107)a,

where vj = (cid:107) ¯Mj(cid:107)b
There are a few differences among the most popular pieces of work.
Negahban and Wainwright (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) consider random Gaussian designs Xj ∼ N (0, Σj) with
random Gaussian noise (and common variance). The regularization norm is l1/l∞. In words, they take the sum of the
absolute values of the maximum element per row in ¯M. This forces sparsity (via the l1 norm), but once a row is selected
there is no penalty in increasing the ¯β components up to the current maximum of the row. They tune λ as in the standard
analysis of Lasso, that is, proportionally to σ2, which is unknown in our case. Results are non-asymptotic, and recovery
happens with high probability when the number of observations is k > Cs(m + log d). They show that if the overlap is not
large enough (2/3 of the support, for m = 2 regression problems), then running independent Lasso estimates has higher
statistical efﬁciency. We can actually directly use the results in (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) if we assume an upper
bound σ2

max ≤ R is known.

(104)

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

Obozinski, Wainwright and Jordan (Obozinski et al., 2011) use l1/l2 block regularization (aka Multivariate Group Lasso).
Their design is random Gaussian, but it is ﬁxed across regressions: Xj = X. They provide asymptotic guarantees under the
scaling k, d, s → ∞, d − s → ∞, and standard assumptions like bounded Σ-eigenspectrum, the irrepresentable condition,
and self-incoherence. The ﬁrst condition is not only required for support recovery, but also for l2 consistency. The last two
conditions are not required for risk consistency, while essential for support recovery. To capture the amount of non-zero
pattern overlap among regressions, they deﬁne the sparsity overlap function ψ, and their sample requirements are a function
of ψ. In particular, one needs k > C ψ log(d − s), where the constant C depends on quantities related to the covariance
matrix of the design matrices, and ψ can be equal to s/m, if all the patterns overlap, and at most s if they are disjoint.
Their theorems use a sequence of regularization parameters

where f (d) → ∞ as d → ∞,

in such a way that λk → 0 as k, d → ∞. Finally, k > 2s is also required. They also provide a two-stage algorithm for
efﬁcient estimation of individual supports for each regression problem. All these optimization problems are convex, and
can be efﬁciently solved in general.
To overcome the issue of common designs (we do not pull each context several times), we use the results by Wang, Liang,
and Xing in (Wang et al., 2013). They extend the guarantees in (Obozinski et al., 2011) to the case where the design
matrices are independently sampled for each regression problem. In order to formally present their result, we describe
some assumptions. Let Σ(i) be the covariance matrix for the design observations of the i-th regression (in our case, they
are all equal to Σ), and S the union of the sparse supports across regressions.

reduced by a factor of m.

Now we show our main result for high-dimensional Trace-UCB, Theorem 20.
Theorem. Let δ1 > 0. Assume (cid:107)βi(cid:107)2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi, Σ) satisfy
conditions C1 to C5 in (Wang et al., 2013). Let ψ be the sparsity overlap function deﬁned in (Obozinski et al., 2011). If

where c ≤ 2
constants c0, c1 > 0, and z = (s/(n − Lm))3/2.
Proof. We start by assuming the recovered support ˆS is equal to the true support S. This event, say ES, holds with
probability at least 1 − δ2 by Theorem 22 when L satisﬁes (112).
Then, we ﬁx δ1 > 0, and run the second stage applying the Trace-UCB algorithm in the s-dimensional space given by the
components in ˆS.
By Theorem 7, if n − Lm ≥ (s + 1)m, then, with probability at least 1 − δ1, the following holds:

recovered the true support, and our ﬁnal estimates for βij for each j (cid:54)∈ S and arm i will be equal to zero, which corresponds

We conclude that (114) holds with probability at least 1 − δ1 − δ2.
One regime of interest is when n = C1 ms log d (cid:28) md. In addition, let us assume complete support overlap across arms,
so ψ = s/Cm. Then, we set the number of initial pulls per arm to be L = C2 s log d, with C1 > C2.
In this case, we have that Corollary 21 holds.
