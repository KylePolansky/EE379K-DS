Abstract

We consider the stochastic bandit problem with a continuous set of arms, with the expected reward function
over the arms assumed to be ﬁxed but unknown. We provide two new Gaussian process-based algorithms for
continuous bandit optimization – Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and
derive corresponding regret bounds. Speciﬁcally, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs
to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian process kernel used as
input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration inequality for vector-
valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly inﬁnite, dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons
to existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that highlight the favorable
gains of the proposed strategies in many cases.

1. Introduction
Optimization over large domains under uncertainty is an important subproblem arising in a variety of sequen-
tial decision making problems, such as dynamic pricing in economics (Besbes and Zeevi, 2009), reinforce-
ment learning with continuous state/action spaces (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Smart and Kaelbling, 2000), and
power control in wireless communication (Chiang et al., 2008). A typical feature of such problems is a large,
or potentially inﬁnite, domain of decision points or covariates (prices, actions, transmit powers), together
with only partial and noisy observability of the associated outcomes (demand, state/reward, communication
rate); reward/loss information is revealed only for decisions that are chosen. This often makes it hard to
balance exploration and exploitation, as available knowledge must be transferred efﬁciently from a ﬁnite set
of observations so far to estimates of the values of inﬁnitely many decisions. A classic case in point is that
of the canonical stochastic MAB with ﬁnitely many arms, where the effort to optimize scales with the total
number of arms or decisions; the effect of this is catastrophic for large or inﬁnite arm sets.

With suitable structure in the values or rewards of arms, however, the challenge of sequential optimization
can be efﬁciently addressed. Parametric bandits, especially linearly parameterized bandits (Rusmevichien-
tong and Tsitsiklis, 2010), represent a well-studied class of structured decision making settings. Here, every
arm corresponds to a known, ﬁnite dimensional vector (its feature vector), and its expected reward is assumed
to be an unknown linear function of its feature vector. This allows for a large, or even inﬁnite, set of arms
all lying in space of ﬁnite dimension, say d, and a rich line of work gives algorithms that attain sublinear
regret with a polynomial dependence on the dimension, e.g., Conﬁdence Ball (Dani et al., 2008), OFUL
(Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) (a strengthening of Conﬁdence Ball) and Thompson sampling for linear bandits

1

(Agrawal and Goyal, 2013)1 The insight here is that even though the number of arms can be large, the number
of unknown parameters (or degrees of freedom) in the problem is really only d, which makes it possible to
learn about the values of many other arms by playing a single arm.

A different approach to modelling bandit problems with a continuum of arms is via the framework of
Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). GPs are a ﬂexible class of nonparametric mod-
els for expressing uncertainty over functions on rather general domain sets, which generalize multivariate
Gaussian random vectors. GPs allow tractable regression for estimating an unknown function given a set of
(noisy) measurements of its values at chosen domain points. The fact that GPs, being distributions on func-
tions, can also help quantify function uncertainty makes it attractive for basing decision making strategies on
them. This has been exploited to great advantage to build nonparametric bandit algorithms, such as GP-UCB
(Srinivas et al., 2009), GP-EI and GP-PI (Hoffman et al., 2011). In fact, GP models for bandit optimization,
in terms of their kernel maps, can be viewed as the parametric linear bandit paradigm pushed to the extreme,
where each feature vector associated to an arm can have inﬁnite dimension 2.

Against this backdrop, our work revisits the problem of bandit optimization with stochastic rewards.
Speciﬁcally, we consider stochastic multiarmed bandit (MAB) problems with a continuous arm set, and
whose (unknown) expected reward function is assumed to lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),
with bounded RKHS norm – this effectively enforces smoothness on the function3. We make the following
contributions-

• We design a new algorithm – Improved Gaussian Process-Upper Conﬁdence Bound (IGP-UCB) – for
stochastic bandit optimization. The algorithm can be viewed as a variant of GP-UCB (Srinivas et al.,
2009), but uses a signiﬁcantly reduced conﬁdence interval width resulting in an order-wise improve-
ment in regret compared to GP-UCB. IGP-UCB also shows a markedly improved numerical perfor-
mance over GP-UCB.

• We develop a nonparametric version of Thompson sampling, called Gaussian Process Thompson sam-
pling (GP-TS), and show that enjoys a regret bound of ˜O
. Here, T is the total time horizon
and γT is a quantity depending on the RKHS containing the reward function. This is, to our knowl-
edge, the ﬁrst known regret bound for Thompson sampling in the agnostic setup with nonparametric
structure.

• We prove a new self-normalized concentration inequality for inﬁnite-dimensional vector-valued mar-
tingales, which is not only key to the design and analysis of the IGP-UCB and GP-TS algorithms, but
also potentially of independent interest. The inequality generalizes a corresponding self-normalized
bound for martingales in ﬁnite dimension proven by Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011).

• Empirical comparisons of the algorithms developed above, with other GP-based algorithms, are pre-
sented, over both synthetic and real-world setups, demonstrating performance improvements of the
proposed algorithms, as well as their performance under misspeciﬁcation.

2. Problem Statement
We consider the problem of sequentially maximizing a ﬁxed but unknown reward function f : D → R over
a (potentially inﬁnite) set of decisions D ⊂ Rd, also called actions or arms. An algorithm for this problem
chooses, at each round t, an action xt ∈ D, and subsequently observes a reward yt = f (xt) + εt, which is a
noisy version of the function value at xt. The action xt is chosen causally depending upon the arms played
and rewards obtained upto round t − 1, denoted by the history Ht−1 = {(xs, ys) : s = 1, . . . , t − 1}. We

tion on the noise (it holds, for instance, for distributions bounded in [−R, R]) and is standard in the bandit
literature (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011; Agrawal and Goyal, 2013).
Regret. The goal of an algorithm is to maximize its cumulative reward or alternatively minimize its cumu-
lative regret – the loss incurred due to not knowing f’s maximum point beforehand. Let x(cid:63) ∈ argmaxx∈D f (x)
be a maximum point of f (assuming the maximum is attained). The instantaneous regret incurred at time t is
rt = f (x(cid:63))− f (xt), and the cumulative regret in a time horizon T (not necessarily known a priori) is deﬁned
t=1 rt. A sub-linear growth of RT in T signiﬁes that RT /T → 0 as T → ∞, or vanishing
Regularity Assumptions. Attaining sub-linear regret is impossible in general for arbitrary reward func-
tions f and domains D, and thus some regularity assumptions are in order. In what follows, we assume
that D is compact. The smoothness assumption we make on the reward function f is motivated by Gaus-
sian processes4 and their associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs, see Sch¨olkopf and Smola
(2002)). Speciﬁcally, we assume that f has small norm in the RKHS of functions D → R, with positive
semi-deﬁnite kernel function k : D × D → R. This RKHS, denoted by Hk(D), is completely speciﬁed
by its kernel function k(·,·) and vice-versa, with an inner product (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)k obeying the reproducing property:
f (x) = (cid:104)f, k(x,·)(cid:105)k for all f ∈ Hk(D). In other words, the kernel plays the role of delta functions to repre-
is a measure of the smoothness5 of f, with respect to the kernel function k, and satisﬁes: f ∈ Hk(D) if and
only if (cid:107)f(cid:107)k < ∞.
We assume a known bound on the RKHS norm of the unknown target function6: (cid:107)f(cid:107)k ≤ B. Moreover,
we assume bounded variance by restricting k(x, x) ≤ 1, for all x ∈ D. Two common kernels that satisfy
bounded variance property are Squared Exponential and Mat´ern, deﬁned as

sent the evaluation map at each point x ∈ D via the RKHS inner product. The RKHS norm (cid:107)f(cid:107)k =(cid:112)(cid:104)f, f(cid:105)k

where l > 0 and ν > 0 are hyperparameters, s = (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107)2 encodes the similarity between two points
x, x(cid:48) ∈ D, and Bν(·) is the modiﬁed Bessel function. Generally the bounded variance property holds for
any stationary kernel, i.e. kernels for which k(x, x(cid:48)) = k(x − x(cid:48)) for all x, x(cid:48) ∈ Rd. These assumptions are
required to make the regret bounds scale-free and are standard in the literature (Agrawal and Goyal, 2013).
Instead if k(x, x) ≤ c or (cid:107)f(cid:107)k ≤ cB, then our regret bounds would increase by a factor of c.

3. Algorithms
Design philosophy. Both the algorithms we propose use Gaussian likelihood models for observations, and
Gaussian process (GP) priors for uncertainty over reward functions. A Gaussian process over D, denoted
by GPD(µ(·), k(·,·)), is a collection of random variables (f (x))x∈D, one for each x ∈ D, such that every
i=1 is jointly Gaussian with mean E [f (xi)] = µ(xi) and
ﬁnite sub-collection of random variables (f (xi))m
covariance E [(f (xi) − µ(xi))(f (xj) − µ(xj))] = k(xi, xj), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m, m ∈ N. The algorithms use
4. Other work has also studied continuum-armed bandits with weaker smoothness assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity – see
5. One way to see this is that for every element g in the RKHS, |g(x)− g(y)| = |(cid:104)g, k(x, ·)− k(y, ·)(cid:105)| ≤ (cid:107)g(cid:107)k (cid:107)k(x, ·) − k(y, ·)(cid:107)k
6. This is analogous to the bound on the weight θ typically assumed in regret analyses of linear parametric bandits.

GPD(0, v2k(·,·)), v > 0, as an initial prior distribution for the unknown reward function f over D, where
k(·,·) is the kernel function associated with the RKHS Hk(D) in which f is assumed to have ‘small’ norm at
most B. The algorithms also assume that the noise variables εt = yt− f (xt) are drawn independently, across
t, from N (0, λv2), with λ ≥ 0. Thus, the prior distribution for each f (x), is assumed to be N (0, v2k(x, x)),
x ∈ D. Moreover, given a set of sampling points At = (x1, . . . , xt) within D, it follows under the assump-
tion that the corresponding vector of observed rewards y1:t = [y1, . . . , yt]T has the multivariate Gaussian
distribution N (0, v2(Kt + λI)), where Kt = [k(x, x(cid:48))]x,x(cid:48)∈At is the kernel matrix at time t. Then, by the
properties of GPs, we have that y1:t and f (x) are jointly Gaussian given At:

where kt(x) = [k(x1, x), . . . , k(xt, x)]T . Therefore conditioned on the history Ht, the posterior distribution
over f is GPD(µt(·), v2kt(·,·)), where

µt(x) = kt(x)T (Kt + λI)−1y1:t,

kt(x, x(cid:48)) = k(x, x(cid:48)) − kt(x)T (Kt + λI)−1kt(x(cid:48)),

Thus for every x ∈ D, the posterior distribution of f (x), given Ht, is N (µt(x), v2σ2

t (x)).

Remark. Note that the GP prior and Gaussian likelihood model described above is only an aid to al-
gorithm design, and has nothing to do with the actual reward distribution or noise model as in the problem
statement (Section 2). The reward function f is a ﬁxed, unknown, member of the RKHS Hk(D), and the
true sequence of noise variables εt is allowed to be a conditionally R-sub-Gaussian martingale difference
sequence (Equation 1). In general, thus, this represents a misspeciﬁed prior and noise model, also termed the
agnostic setting by Srinivas et al. (2009).

The proposed algorithms, to follow, assume the knowledge of only the sub-Gaussianity parameter R,
kernel function k and upper bound B on the RKHS norm of f. Note that v, λ are free parameters (possibly
time-dependent) that can be set speciﬁc to the algorithm.

3.1 Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) Algorithm
We introduce the IGP-UCB algorithm (Algorithm 1), that uses a combination of the current posterior mean
µt−1(x) and standard deviation vσt−1(x) to (a) construct an upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) envelope for the
actual function f over D, and (b) choose an action to maximize it. Speciﬁcally it chooses, at each round t,
the action

µt−1(x) + βtσt−1(x),

σt−1(x)) with exploitation (picking points with high reward µt−1(x)), with βt = B+R(cid:112)2(γt−1 + 1 + ln(1/δ))

with the scale parameter v set to be 1. Such a rule trades off exploration (picking points with high uncertainty

x∈D

being the parameter governing the tradeoff, which we later show is related to the width of the conﬁdence in-
terval for f at round t. δ ∈ (0, 1) is a free conﬁdence parameter used by the algorithm, and γt is the maximum
information gain at time t, deﬁned as:

(5)

γt := max

I(yA; fA).

Here, I(yA; fA) denotes the mutual information between fA = [f (x)]x∈A and yA = fA + εA, where
εA ∼ N (0, λv2I) and quantiﬁes the reduction in uncertainty about f after observing yA at points A ⊂ D.
γt is a problem dependent quantity and can be found given the knowledge of domain D and kernel function
k. For a compact subset D of Rd, γT is O((ln T )d+1) and O(T d(d+1)/(2ν+d(d+1)) ln T ), respectively, for the
Squared Exponential and Mat´ern kernels (Srinivas et al., 2009), depending only polylogarithmically on the
time T .

Discussion. Srinivas et al. (2009) have proposed the GP-UCB algorithm, and Valko et al. (2013) the
KernelUCB algorithm, for sequentially optimizing reward functions lying in the RKHS Hk(D). Both al-
gorithms play an arm at time t using the rule: xt = argmaxx∈D µt−1(x) + ˜βtσt−1(x). GP-UCB uses the
exploration parameter ˜βt =
2B2 + 300γt−1 ln3(t/δ), with λ set to σ2, where σ is additionally assumed to
be a known, uniform (i.e., almost-sure) upper bound on all noise variables εt (Srinivas et al., 2009, Theorem
3). Compared to GP-UCB, IGP-UCB (Algorithm 1) reduces the width of the conﬁdence interval by a factor
roughly O(ln3/2 t) at every round t, and, as we will see, this small but critical adjustment leads to much better
theoretical and empirical performance compared to GP-UCB. In KernelUCB, ˜βt is set as η/λ1/2, where η
is the exploration parameter and λ is the regularization constant. Thus IGP-UCB can be viewed as a special
case of KernelUCB where η = βt.

3.2 Gaussian Process Thompson Sampling (GP-TS)

and parametric bandits (Agrawal and Goyal, 2012; Kaufmann et al., 2012; Gopalan et al., 2014; Agrawal

7. We call it GP-Thompson-Sampling as it falls under the general framework of
Thompson Sampling, i.e., (a) assume a prior on the underlying parameters of the reward distribution, (b) play
the arm according to the prior probability that it is optimal, and (c) observe the outcome and update the prior.
However, note that the prior is nonparametric in this case.

Dt is chosen as a suitable discretization of D, so we include Dt as an algorithmic parameter.

t=1 be a real-valued stochastic process such
that for some R ≥ 0 and for all t ≥ 1, εt is (a) Ft-measurable, and (b) R-sub-Gaussian conditionally on

η > 0, with probability at least 1 − δ, the following holds simultaneously over all t ≥ 0:

deviation is measured by the norm weighted by V −1
, which is itself derived from St. Theorem 1 represents
the kernelized generalization of the ﬁnite-dimensional result of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011), and we recover
their result under the special case of a linear kernel: ϕ(x) = x for all x ∈ Rd.

We remark that when ϕ is a mapping to a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, the argument of Abbasi-
Yadkori et al. (2011, Theorem 1) can be lifted to establish Theorem 1, but it breaks down in the generalized,
inﬁnite-dimensional RKHS setting, as the self-normalized bound in their paper has an explicit, growing
dependence on the feature dimension. Speciﬁcally, the method of mixtures (de la Pena et al., 2009) or Laplace
method, as dubbed by Maillard (2016) (Lemma 5.2), fails to hold in inﬁnite dimension. The primary reason
for this is that the mixture distribution for ﬁnite dimensional spaces can be chosen independently of time,

but in a nonparametric setup like ours, where the dimensionality of the self-normalizing factor(cid:0)K−1

t + I(cid:1)−1

itself grows with time, the use of (random) stopping times, precludes using time-dependent mixtures. We get
around this difﬁculty by applying a novel ‘double mixture’ construction, in which a pair of mixtures on (a)
the space of real-valued functions on Rd, i.e., the support of a Gaussian process, and (b) on real sequences
is simultaneously used to obtain a more general result, of potentially independent interest (see Section 5 and
the appendix for details).

Our next result shows that how the posterior mean is concentrated around the unknown reward function

f.

Theorem 2 Under the same hypotheses as those of Theorem 1, let D ⊂ Rd, and f : D → R be a member
of the RKHS of real-valued functions on D with kernel k, with RKHS norm bounded by B. Then, with

Theorem 3.5 of Maillard (2016) states a similar result on the estimation of the unknown reward function from
the RKHS. We improve upon it in the sense that the conﬁdence bound in Theorem 2 is simultaneous over all
x ∈ D, while the bound has been shown only for a single, ﬁxed x in the Kernel Least-squares setting. We are
able to achieve this result by virtue of Theorem 1.

more general, and we are able to obtain a O(ln3/2 T ) multiplicative factor improvement in the ﬁnal regret
bound thanks to the new self-normalized inequality (Theorem 1). Additionally, in our numerical experiments,
we observe a signiﬁcantly improved performance of IGP-UCB over GP-UCB, both on synthetically generated

by GP-TS is restricted to be a unique discretization Dt of D with the property that |f (x) − f ([x]t)| ≤ 1/t2
for all x ∈ D, where [x]t is the closest point to x in Dt. This can always be achieved by choosing a
compact and convex domain D ⊂ [0, r]d and discretization Dt with size |Dt| = (BLrdt2)d such that
(cid:107)x − [x]t(cid:107)1 ≤ rd/BLrdt2 = 1/BLt2 for all x ∈ D, where L = sup
. This

implies, for every x ∈ D,

GP-TS is essentially a consequence of discretization. How to remove this extra logarithmic dependency, and
make the analysis discretization-independent, remains an open question.

Remark. The regret bound for GP-TS is inferior compared to IGP-UCB in terms of the dependency
on dimension d, but to the best of our knowledge, Theorem 4 is the ﬁrst (frequentist) regret guarantee of
Thompson Sampling in the agnostic, non-parametric setting of inﬁnite action spaces.
Linear Models and a Matching Lower Bound. If the mean rewards are perfectly linear, i.e. if there
exists a θ ∈ Rd such that f (x) = θT x for all x ∈ D, then we are in the parametric setup, and one way
of casting this in the kernelized framework is by using the linear kernel k(x, x(cid:48)) = xT x(cid:48). For this kernel,
γT = O(d ln T ), and the regret scaling of IGP-UCB is ˜O(d
T ), which
recovers the regret bounds of their linear, parametric analogues OFUL (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) and
Linear Thompson sampling (Agrawal and Goyal, 2013), respectively. Moreover, in this case ˜d = d, thus
d factor away from that of KernelUCB. But the regret bound of KernelUCB also

depends on the number of arms N, and if N is exponential in d, then it also suffers ˜O(d
T ) regret. We
remark that a similar O(ln3/2 T ) factor improvement, as obtained by IGP-UCB over GP-UCB, was achieved
in the linear parametric setting by Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011) in the OFUL algorithm, over its predecessor
ConﬁdenceBall (Dani et al., 2008). Finally we see that the for linear bandit problem with inﬁnitely many
actions, IGP-UCB attains the information theoretic lower bound of Ω(d
T ) (see Dani et al. (2008)), but
GP-TS is a factor of

5. Overview of Techniques
We brieﬂy outline here the key arguments for all the theorems in Section 4. Formal proofs and auxiliary
lemmas required are given in the appendix.
(cid:111)
Proof Sketch for Theorem 1. It is convenient to assume that Kt, the induced kernel matrix at time t, is
invertible, since this is where the crux of the argument lies. First we show that for any function g : D → R
and for all t ≥ 0, thanks to the sub-Gaussian property (1), the process
is a non-negative super-martingale with respect to the ﬁltration Ft, where g1:t := [g(x1), . . . , g(xt)]T and in
t ] ≤ 1. The chief difﬁculty is to handle the behavior of Mt at a (random) stopping time,
fact satisﬁes E [M g
since the sizes of quantities such as ε1:t at the stopping time will be random.

any desired ﬁnite dimension t, thus obtaining Mt =

fact that E [Mτ ] ≤ 1 and from Markov’s inequality, for any δ ∈ (0, 1), we obtain

appendix).

Proof Sketch for Theorem 4. We follow a similar approach given in Agrawal and Goyal (2013) to prove
the regret bound of GP-TS. First observe that from our choice of discretization sets Dt, the instantaneous
regret at round t is given by rt = f (x(cid:63)) − f ([x(cid:63)]t) + f ([x(cid:63)]t) − f (xt) ≤ 1
t2 + ∆t(xt), where ∆t(x) :=
f ([x(cid:63)]t) − f (x) and [x(cid:63)]t is the closest point to x(cid:63) in Dt. Now at each round t, after an action is chosen, our
algorithm improves the conﬁdence about true reward function f, via an update of µt(·) and kt(·,·). However,
if we play a suboptimal arm, the regret suffered can be much higher than the improvement of our knowledge.
To overcome this difﬁculty, at any round t, we divide the arms (in the present discretization Dt) into two
groups: saturated arms, St, deﬁned as those with ∆t(x) > ctσt−1(x) and unsaturated otherwise, where ct
is an appropriate constant (see Deﬁnition 1, 3). The idea is to show that the probability of playing a saturated
arm is small and then bound the regret of playing an unsaturated arm in terms of standard deviation. This
T γT ) (Lemma 4) allows us to bound the total regret

due to unsaturated arms.
First we lower bound the probability of playing an unsaturated arm at round t. We deﬁne a ﬁltra-
t−1 as the history Ht−1 up to round t − 1 and prove that for “most” (in a high probability sense)

with concentration bounds for ft(x) and f (x) (Lemma 6) and “smoothness” of f (Equation 7), allow us
to show that the expected regret at round t is upper bounded in terms of σt−1(xt), i.e.
in terms of re-
gret due to playing an unsaturated arm. More precisely, we show that for “most” F (cid:48)

6. Experiments
In this section we provide numerical results on both synthetically generated test functions and functions from
real-world data. We compare GP-UCB, IGP-UCB and GP-TS with GP-EI and GP-PI11.

Synthetic Test Functions. We use the following procedure to generate test functions from the RKHS.
First we sample 100 points uniformly from the interval [0, 1] and use that as our decision set. Then we
compute a kernel matrix K on those points and draw reward vector y ∼ N (0, K). Finally, the mean of
the resulting posterior distribution is used as the test function f. We set noise parameter R2 to be 1% of
function range and use λ = R2. We used Squared Exponential kernel with lengthscale parameter l = 0.2 and
Mat´ern kernel with parameters ν = 2.5, l = 0.2. Parameters βt, ˜βt, vt of IGP-UCB, GP-UCB and GP-TS are
chosen as given in Section 3, with δ = 0.1, B2 = f T Kf and γt set according to theoretical upper bounds for
corresponding kernels. We run each algorithm for T = 30000 iterations, over 25 independent trials (samples
from the RKHS) and plot the average cumulative regret along with standard deviations (Figure 1). We see a
signiﬁcant improvement in the performance of IGP-UCB over GP-UCB. In fact IGP-UCB performs the best
in the pool of competitors, while GP-TS also fares reasonably well compared to GP-UCB and GP-EI/GP-PI.
We next sample 25 random functions from the GP (0, K) and perform the same experiment (Figure 2)
for both kernels with exactly same set of parameters. The relative performance of all methods is similar to

11. GP-EI and PI perform similarly and thus are not separately distinguishable in the plots.

that in the previous experiment, which is the arguably harder “agnostic” setting of a ﬁxed, unknown target
function.

Standard Test Functions. We consider 2 well-known synthetic benchmark functions for Bayesian Op-
timization: Rosenbrock and Hartman3 (see Azimi et al. (2012) for exact analytical expressions). We sample
100 d points uniformly from the domain of each benchmark function, d being the dimension of respective
domain, as the decision set. We consider the Squared Exponential kernel with l = 0.2 and set all parameters
exactly as in previous experiment. The cumulative regret for 25 independent trials on Rosenbrock and Hart-
man3 benchmarks is shown in Figure 3. We see GP-EI/PI perform better than the rest, while IGP-UCB and
GP-TS show competitive performance. Here no algorithm is aware of the underlying kernel function, hence

we conjecture that the UCB- and TS- based algorithms are somewhat less robust on the choice of kernel than
EI/PI.

Temperature Sensor Data. We use temperature data12 collected from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel
Berkeley Research lab between February 28th and April 5th, 2004 with samples collected at 30 second
intervals. We tested all algorithms in the context of learning the maximum reading of the sensors collected
between 8 am to 9 am. We take measurements of ﬁrst 5 consecutive days (starting Feb. 28th 2004) to
learn algorithm parameters. Following Srinivas et al. (2009), we calculate the empirical covariance matrix
of the sensor measurements and use it as the kernel matrix in the algorithms. Here R2 is set to be 5% of
the average empirical variance of sensor readings and other algorithm parameters is set similarly as in the
previous experiment with γt = 1 (found via cross-validation). The functions for testing consist of one set of
measurements from all sensors in the two following days and the cumulative regret is plotted over all such test
functions. From Figure 4, we see that IGP-UCB and GP-UCB performs the same, while GP-TS outperforms
all its competitors.

Light Sensor Data. We take light sensor data collected in the CMU Intelligent Workplace in Nov 2005,
which is available online as Matlab structure13 and contains locations of 41 sensors, 601 train samples and 192
test samples. We compute the kernel matrix, estimate the noise and set other algorithm parameters exactly
as in the previous experiment. Here also GP-TS is found to perform better than the others, with IGP-UCB
performing better than GP-EI/PI (Figure 4).
Related work. An alternative line of work pertaining to X -armed bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck
et al., 2011; Carpentier and Valko, 2015; Azar et al., 2014) studies continuum-armed bandits with smoothness
structure. For instance, (Bubeck et al., 2011) show that with a Lipschitzness assumption on the reward
d+1
function, algorithms based on discretizing the domain yield nontrivial regret guarantees, of order Ω(T
d+2 )
in Rd. Other Bayesian approaches to function optimization are GP-EI (Moˇckus, 1975), GP-PI (Kushner,
1964), GP-EST (Wang et al., 2016) and GP-UCB, including the contextual (Krause and Ong, 2011), high-
dimensional (Djolonga et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), time-varying (Bogunovic et al., 2016) safety-aware
(Gotovos et al., 2015), budget-constraint (Hoffman et al., 2013) and noise-free (De Freitas et al., 2012)
settings. Other relevant work focuses on best arm identiﬁcation problem in the Bayesian setup considering
pure exploration (Gr¨unew¨alder et al., 2010). For Thompson sampling (TS), Russo and Van Roy (2014)

prior. Our work obtains the ﬁrst frequentist regret of TS for unknown, ﬁxed functions from an RKHS.

7. Conclusion
For bandit optimization, we have improved upon the existing GP-UCB algorithm, and introduced a new GP-
TS algorithm. The proposed algorithms perform well in practice both on synthetic and real-world data. An
interesting case is when the kernel function is also not known to the algorithms a priori and needs to be
learnt adaptively. Moreover, one can consider classes of time varying functions from the RKHS, and general
reinforcement learning with GP techniques. There are also important questions on computational aspects of
optimizing functions drawn from GPs.

An argument similar to (8) also shows that E [Mτ ] ≤ 1 for any stopping time τ. Now, without loss of
generality, we assume R = 1 (this can always be achieved through appropriate scaling), and compute

(cid:13)(cid:13)[h(x1) . . . h(xt)]T + z(cid:13)(cid:13)2(cid:17)

dµ1(h)dµ2(z)

where µ1 is the Gaussian process measure GPD(0, k) over the function space RD ≡ {g : D → R}, µ2 is
the multivariate Gaussian distribution on Rt with mean 0 and covariance ηI where I is the identify, du is
standard Lebesgue measure on Rt, and f is the density of the random vector [h(x1) . . . h(xt)]T + z, which
is distributed as the multivariate Gaussian N (0, Kt + ηI) given the sampled points x1, . . . , xt up to round t,
where Kt is the induced kernel matrix at time t given by Kt(i, j) = k(xi, xj), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t. (Note: Kt is not
positive deﬁnite and invertible when there are repetitions among (x1, . . . , xt), but Kt + ηI is).

by the inequality (9).

When Kt is positive deﬁnite (and hence invertible) for each t ≥ 1, one can use a similar construction
as in Part 1, with η = 0 (i.e., N is the all-zeros sequence with probability 1), to recover the corresponding
conclusion (6) with η = 0.

B. Information Theoretic Results

satisfy, almost surely, the following :

γt ≥ 1

Proof At round t after observing the reward vector y1:t at points At = {x1, . . . , xt} ⊂ D, the information
gain - by the algorithm - about the unknown reward function f is given by the mutual information between
f1:t and y1:t sampled at points At:

(cid:12)(cid:12) f1:t),

I(y1:t; f1:t) = H(y1:t) − H(y1:t

17

where y1:t = f1:t + ε1:t = [y1, . . . , yt]T , f1:t = [f (x1), . . . , f (xt)]T and ε1:t = [ε1, . . . , εt]T . Clearly, given
f1:t the randomness - as perceived by the algorithm - in y1:t are only in the noise vector ε1:t and thus

(cid:12)(cid:12) f1:t) =

H(y1:t

ln(det(2πeλv2I)) =

as ε1:t is assumed to follow the distribution N (0, λv2I) and H(N (µ, Σ)) = 1

Now I(y1:t; f1:t) is a function of At ⊂ D, the random points chosen by the algorithm and thus

I(y1:t; f1:t) ≤ max

A⊂D:|A|=t

I(yA; fA) = γt, a.s.,

Now the proof follows from Equation 10 and 11.

Lemma 4 Let x1, . . . xt be the points selected by the algorithms. The sum of predictive standard deviation
at those points can be expressed in terms of the maximum information gain. More precisely,

σt−1(xt) ≤(cid:112)4(T + 2)γT .

T(cid:88)

t−1(x) ≤ 1 for all x ∈ D and by our choice of λ = 1 + η, η ≥ 0, we have λ−1σ2

Proof First note that, by Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,(cid:80)T

t−1(xt) ≤

t−1(xt)) ≤(cid:112)4T (1 + η)γT ,

0 ≤ σ2
2 ln(1+λ−1σ2
Thus we get σ2

where the last inequality follows from Lemma 3. Now the result follows by choosing η = 2/T .

C. Proof of Theorem 2
First deﬁne ϕ(x) as k(x,·), where ϕ : Rd → H maps any point x in the primal space Rd to the RKHS
H associated with kernel function k. For any two functions g, h ∈ H, deﬁne the inner product (cid:104)g, h(cid:105)k as

gT h and the RKHS norm (cid:107)g(cid:107)k as(cid:112)gT g. Now as the unknown reward function f lies in the RKHS Hk(D),

18

Φt :=(cid:2)ϕ(x1)T , . . . , ϕ(xt)T(cid:3)T , we get the kernel matrix Kt = ΦtΦT

these deﬁnitions along with reproducing property of the RKHS imply f (x) = (cid:104)f, k(x,·)(cid:105)k = (cid:104)f, ϕ(x)(cid:105)k =
f T ϕ(x) and k(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)k(x,·), k(x(cid:48),·)(cid:105)k = (cid:104)ϕ(x), ϕ(x(cid:48))(cid:105)k = ϕ(x)T ϕ(x(cid:48)) for all x, x(cid:48) ∈ D. Now deﬁning

t Φt +

(Kt + ηI)(Kt + (1 + η)I)−1 = ((Kt + ηI)−1 + I)−1.

Now see that

Now using Theorem 1, for any δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1 − δ, ∀t ≥ 0,∀x ∈ D, we obtain

Proof Fix x ∈ D and t ≥ 1. Given history Ht−1, ft(x) ∼ N (µt−1(x), v2

holds with probability at least 1 − δ, given any possible realizations of history Ht−1. Now setting δ = 1/t2,
the result follows.

Deﬁnition 1 Deﬁne For all t ≥ 1, ˜ct = (cid:112)4 ln t + 2d ln(BLrdt2) and ct = vt(1 + ˜ct), where vt = B +
R(cid:112)2(γt−1 + 1 + ln(2/δ)). Clearly, ct increases with t.

Deﬁnition 2 Deﬁne Ef (t) as the event that for all x ∈ D,

|µt−1(x) − f (x)| ≤ vtσt−1(x),

and Eft(t) as the event that for all x ∈ Dt,

|ft(x) − µt−1(x)| ≤ vt˜ctσt−1(x).

Deﬁnition 3 Deﬁne the set of saturated points St in discretization Dt at round t as

St := {x ∈ Dt : ∆t(x) > ctσt−1(x)},

where ∆t(x) := f ([x(cid:63)]t) − f (x), the difference between function values at the closest point to x(cid:63) in Dt and
at x. Clearly ∆t([x(cid:63)]t) = 0 for all t, and hence [x(cid:63)]t ∈ Dt is unsaturated at every t.

Proof At round t our algorithm chooses the point xt ∈ Dt, at which the highest value of ft, within cur-
rent decision set Dt, is attained. Now if ft([x(cid:63)]t) is greater than ft(x) for all saturated points at round t,
i.e.,ft([x(cid:63)]t) > ft(x),∀x ∈ St, then one of the unsaturated points (which includes [x(cid:63)]t) in Dt must be
played and hence xt ∈ Dt \ St. This implies

xt ∈ Dt \ St

ft([x(cid:63)]t) > ft(x),∀x ∈ St

t−1

(14)
Now form Deﬁnition 3, ∆t(x) > ctσt−1(x), for all x ∈ St. Also if both the events Ef (t) and Eft(t)
are true, then from Deﬁnition 1 and 2, ft(x) ≤ f (x) + ctσt−1(x), for all x ∈ Dt. Thus for all x ∈ St,
ft(x) < f (x) + ∆t(x). Therefore, for any ﬁltration F (cid:48)
t−1 such that Ef (t) is true, either Eft(t) is false, or
else for all x ∈ St, ft(x) < f ([x(cid:63)]t). Hence, for any F (cid:48)

Deﬁnition 1 and 2, f (x) − ctσt−1(x) ≤ ft(x) ≤ f (x) + ctσt−1(x), for all x ∈ Dt. Using this observation
along with Deﬁnition 3 and the facts that ft(xt) ≥ ft(x) for all x ∈ Dt and ¯xt ∈ Dt \ St, we have

∆t(xt) = f ([x(cid:63)]t) − f (¯xt) + f (¯xt) − f (xt)

≤ ∆t(¯xt) + ft(¯xt) + ctσt−1(¯xt) − ft(xt) + ctσt−1(xt)

∆t(x) ≤ 2 sup

|f (x)| ≤ 2B. Thus, using Equation 16, we get

We now describe a procedure to update the posterior mean and covariance function in a recursive fashion

µt(x) = µt−1(x) +

First we write the matrix Kt + λI as

D = λ + k(xt, xt). Now using Schur’s complement we get

(cid:20)A B

(cid:21)−1

C D

where β = (D − CA−1B)−1 = 1/(D − BT A−1B), γ = A−1BBT A−1 and α = A−1B. Therefore we
have

25

where
kt−1(x)T A−1y1:t−1 = kt−1(x)T (Kt−1 + λI)−1y1:t−1 = µt−1(x),

kt−1(x)T γy1:t−1 = kt−1(x)T A−1kt−1(xt)kt−1(xt)T A−1y1:t−1 =(cid:0)kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x)(cid:1) µt−1(xt),

αT y1:t−1 = kt−1(xt)T A−1y1:t−1 = µt−1(xt),
αT kt−1(x) = kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x).

Thus we have

(cid:16)

µt(x) = µt−1(x) + β

= µt−1(x) + β (yt − µt−1(xt))(cid:0)k(xt, x) − kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x)(cid:1)

kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x) (µt−1(xt) − yt) + k(xt, x) (yt − µt−1(xt))

= µt−1(x) + βkt−1(xt, x)(yt − µt−1(xt)).

Now as

D − BT A−1B = λ + k(xt, xt) − kt−1(xt)T (Kt−1 + λI)−1kt−1(xt) = λ + σ2

t−1(xt),

putting β = 1/(λ + σ2

t−1(xt)), we obtain Equation 19. Again observe that

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

= k(x, x(cid:48)) − kt(x)T (Kt + λI)−1kt(x(cid:48))
= k(x, x(cid:48)) − kt−1(x)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48))

kt(x, x(cid:48))

(cid:16)

+β

Now we have

kt−1(x)T γkt−1(x(cid:48)) − k(xt, x)αT kt−1(x(cid:48)) − k(xt, x(cid:48))αT kt−1(x) + k(xt, x)k(xt, x(cid:48))

.

k(x, x(cid:48)) − kt−1(x)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48)) = k(x, x(cid:48)) − kt−1(x)T (Kt−1 + λI)−1kt−1(x(cid:48)) = kt−1(x, x(cid:48)),

also

and

kt−1(x)T γkt−1(x(cid:48)) − k(xt, x)αT kt−1(x(cid:48))

= kt−1(x)T A−1kt−1(xt)kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48)) − k(xt, x)kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48))

k(xt, x)k(xt, x(cid:48)) − k(xt, x(cid:48))αT kt−1(x) = k(xt, x(cid:48))(k(xt, x) − kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x))

= k(xt, x(cid:48))kt−1(xt, x).

Putting all these together we get

kt(x, x(cid:48)) = kt−1(x, x(cid:48)) − β
= kt−1(x, x(cid:48)) − β
= kt−1(x, x(cid:48)) − βkt−1(xt, x)kt−1(xt, x(cid:48)).

kt−1(xt, x)

(cid:16)

(cid:16)
(cid:16)

k(xt, x(cid:48))kt−1(xt, x) − kt−1(xt, x)kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48))

k(xt, x(cid:48)) − kt−1(xt)T A−1kt−1(x(cid:48))

(cid:17)

(cid:17)(cid:17)

Now Equation 20 and 21 follows by using β = 1/(λ + σ2

t−1(x)) and σ2

t (x) = kt(x, x).
