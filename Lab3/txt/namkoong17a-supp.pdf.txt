Adaptive Sampling Probabilities for Non-Smooth Optimization

Abstract

Standard forms of coordinate and stochastic gra-
dient methods do not adapt to structure in data;
their good behavior under random sampling is
predicated on uniformity in data. When gradi-
ents in certain blocks of features (for coordinate
descent) or examples (for SGD) are larger than
others, there is a natural structure that can be ex-
ploited for quicker convergence. Yet adaptive
variants often suffer nontrivial computational
overhead. We present a framework that discov-
ers and leverages such structural properties at a
low computational cost. We employ a bandit op-
timization procedure that “learns” probabilities
for sampling coordinates or examples in (non-
smooth) optimization problems, allowing us to
guarantee performance close to that of the opti-
mal stationary sampling distribution. When such
structures exist, our algorithms achieve tighter
convergence guarantees than their non-adaptive
counterparts, and we complement our analysis
with experiments on several datasets.

1. Introduction
Identifying and adapting to structural aspects of problem
data can often improve performance of optimization algo-
rithms. In this paper, we study two forms of such structure:
variance in the relative importance of different features and
observations (as well as blocks thereof). As a motivating
concrete example, consider the (cid:96)p regression problem

(features) of A have highly varying norms—say because

certain features are infrequent—we wish to leverage this
during optimization. Likewise, when rows ai have dis-
parate norms, “heavy” rows of A inﬂuence the objective
more than others. We develop optimization algorithms that
automatically adapt to such irregularities for general non-
smooth convex optimization problems.
Standard (stochastic) subgradient methods (Nemirovski
et al., 2009), as well as more recent accelerated variants for
smooth, strongly convex incremental optimization prob-
lems (e.g. Johnson and Zhang, 2013; Defazio et al., 2014),
follow deterministic or random procedures that choose data
to use to compute updates in ways that are oblivious to con-
ditioning and structure. As our experiments demonstrate,
choosing blocks of features or observations—for instance,
all examples belonging to a particular class in classiﬁca-
tion problems—can be advantageous. Adapting to such
structure can lead to substantial gains, and we propose
a method that adaptively updates the sampling probabil-
ities from which it draws blocks of features/observations
(columns/rows in problem (1)) as it performs subgradient
updates. Our method applies to both coordinate descent
(feature/column sampling) and mirror descent (observa-
tion/row sampling). Heuristically, our algorithm learns to
sample informative features/observations using their gradi-
ent values and requires overhead only logarithmic in the
number of blocks over which it samples. We show that
our method optimizes a particular bound on convergence,
roughly sampling from the optimal stationary probability
distribution in hindsight, and leading to substantial im-
provements when the data has pronounced irregularity.
When the objective f (·) is smooth and the desired solu-
tion accuracy is reasonably low, (block) coordinate descent
methods are attractive because of their tractability (Nes-
terov, 2012; Necoara et al., 2011; Beck and Tetruashvili,
2013; Lee and Sidford, 2013; Richt´arik and Tak´aˇc, 2014;
Lu and Xiao, 2015). In this paper, we consider potentially
non-smooth functions and present an adaptive block co-
ordinate descent method, which iterates over b blocks of
coordinates, reminiscent of AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011).
Choosing a good sampling distribution for coordinates
in coordinate descent procedures is nontrivial (Lee and
Sidford, 2013; Necoara et al., 2011; Shalev-Shwartz and
Zhang, 2012; Richt´arik and Tak´aˇc, 2015; Csiba et al., 2015;
Allen-Zhu and Yuan, 2015). Most work focuses on choos-

Adaptive Sampling Probabilities for Non-Smooth Optimization

ing a good stationary distribution using problem-speciﬁc
knowledge, which may not be feasible; this motivates auto-
matically adapting to individual problem instances. For ex-
ample, Csiba et al. (2015) provide an updating scheme for
the probabilities in stochastic dual ascent. However, the up-
date requires O(b) time per iteration, making it impractical
for large-scale problems. Similarly, Nutini et al. (2015) ob-
serve that the Gauss-Southwell rule (choosing the coordi-
nate with maximum gradient value) achieves better perfor-
mance, but this also requires O(b) time per iteration. Our
method roughly emulates this behavior via careful adaptive
sampling and bandit optimization, and we are able to pro-
vide a number of a posteriori optimality guarantees.
In addition to coordinate descent methods, we also consider
the ﬁnite-sum minimization problem

n(cid:88)

i=1

minimize

x∈X

1
n

fi(x),

where the fi are convex and may be non-smooth. Variance-
reduction techniques for ﬁnite-sum problems often yield
substantial gains (Johnson and Zhang, 2013; Defazio et al.,
2014), but
they generally require smoothness. More
broadly, importance sampling estimates (Strohmer and Ver-
shynin, 2009; Needell et al., 2014; Zhao and Zhang, 2014;
2015; Csiba and Richt´arik, 2016) can yield improved con-
vergence, but the only work that allows online, problem-
speciﬁc adaptation of sampling probabilities of which we
are aware is Gopal (2016). However, these updates require
O(b) computation and do not have optimality guarantees.
We develop these ideas in the coming sections, focusing
ﬁrst in Section 2 on adaptive procedures for (non-smooth)
coordinate descent methods and developing the necessary
bandit optimization and adaptivity machinery. In Section 3,
we translate our development into convergence results for
ﬁnite-sum convex optimization problems. Complementing
our theoretical results, we provide a number of experiments
in Section 4 that show the importance of our algorithmic
development and the advantages of exploiting block struc-
tures in problem data.

2. Adaptive sampling for coordinate descent
We begin with the convex optimization problem

(2)

minimize

f (x)

x∈X

of closed convex sets Xj ⊂ Rdj with (cid:80)

where X = X1 × ··· × Xb ⊂ Rd is a Cartesian product
j dj = d, and
f is convex and Lipschitz. When there is a natural block
structure in the problem, some blocks have larger gradi-
ent norms than others, and we wish to sample these blocks
more often in the coordinate descent algorithm. To that

end, we develop an adaptive procedure that exploits vari-
ability in block “importance” online. In the coming sec-
tions, we show that we obtain certain near-optimal guar-
antees, and that the computational overhead over a simple
random choice of block j ∈ [b] is at most O(log b).
In
addition, under some natural structural assumptions on the
blocks and problem data, we show how our adaptive sam-
pling scheme provides convergence guarantees polynomi-
ally better in the dimension than those of naive uniform
sampling or gradient descent.

Notation for coordinate descent Without loss of gen-
rality we assume that the ﬁrst d1 coordinates of x ∈ Rd
correspond to X1, the second d2 to X2, and so on. We let
Uj ∈ {0, 1}d×dj be the matrix identifying the jth block, so
that Id = [U1 ··· Ud]. We deﬁne the projected subgradient
vectors for each block j by

Gj(x) = UjU(cid:62)

j f(cid:48)(x) ∈ Rd,

where f(cid:48)(x) ∈ ∂f (x) is a ﬁxed element of the subdiffer-
j x ∈ Rdj and G[j](x) =
ential ∂f (x). Deﬁne x[j] := U(cid:62)
j f(cid:48)(x) ∈ Rdj . Let ψj denote a differen-
U(cid:62)
j Gj(x) = U(cid:62)
tiable 1-strongly convex function on Xj with respect to the
norm (cid:107)·(cid:107)j, meaning for all ∆ ∈ Rdj we have

(cid:0)x[j] + ∆(cid:1) ≥ ψj

and let (cid:107)·(cid:107)j,∗ be the dual norm of (cid:107)·(cid:107)j. Let Bj(u, v) =
ψj(u) − ψj(v) − ∇ψj(v)(cid:62)(u − v) be the Bregman diver-
gence associated with ψj, and deﬁne the tensorized diver-
j=1 Bj(x[j], y[j]). Throughout the pa-
per, we assume the following.
Assumption 1. For all x, y ∈ X , we have B(x, y) ≤ R2

gence B(x, y) :=(cid:80)b
and(cid:13)(cid:13)G[j](x)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

j,∗ ≤ L2/b for j = 1, . . . , b.

2.1. Coordinate descent for non-smooth functions

The starting point of our analysis is the simple observation
that if a coordinate J ∈ [b] is chosen according to a proba-
bility vector p > 0, then the importance sampling estimator
GJ (x)/pJ satisﬁes Ep[GJ (x)/pJ ] = f(cid:48)(x) ∈ ∂f (x).
Thus the randomized coordinate subgradient method
of Algorithm 1 is essentially a stochastic mirror de-
scent method (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983; Beck and
Teboulle, 2003; Nemirovski et al., 2009), and as long
as supx∈X E[(cid:107)p−1
J GJ (x)(cid:107)2∗] < ∞ it converges at rate
√
T ). With this insight, a variant of standard stochas-
O(1/
tic mirror descent analysis yields the following conver-
gence guarantee for Algorithm 1 with non-stationary prob-
abilities (cf. Dang and Lan (2015), who do not quite as
carefully track dependence on the sampling distribution

more concrete, we consider sampling from the uniform dis-
tribution pt ≡ 1
1 so that pmin = 1/b, and assume homo-
geneous block sizes dj = d/b for simplicity. Algorithm 1
solves problem (2) to -accuracy within O(bR2L2/2) it-
erations, where each iteration approximately costs O(d/b)
plus the cost of projecting into Xj. In contrast, mirror de-
scent with the same constraints and divergence B achieves
the same accuracy within O(R2L2/2) iterations, taking
O(d) time plus the cost of projecting to X per iteration. As
the projection costs are linear in the number b of blocks, the
two algorithms are comparable.
In practice, coordinate descent procedures can signiﬁcantly
outperform full gradient updates through efﬁcient memory
usage. For huge problems, coordinate descent methods can
leverage data locality by choosing appropriate block sizes
so that each gradient block ﬁts in local memory.

2.2. Optimal stepsizes by doubling

(cid:80)T

In the the upper bound (3), we wish to choose the optimal
stepsize αx that minimizes this bound. However, the term

(cid:3) is unknown a priori. We cir-

cumvent this issue by using the doubling trick (e.g. Shalev-

of the optimal stepsize that minimizes the regret bound (3).

By using a bandit algorithm—another coordinate descent

performance comparable to the best stationary probability
in ∆b in hindsight. To this end, we ﬁrst bound the regret (4)
by the regret of a linear bandit problem. By convexity of

Now, let us view the vector (∗) as the loss vector for a con-
strained linear bandit problem with feasibility region ∆b.
We wish to apply EXP3 (due to Auer et al. (2002)) or equiv-
alently, a 1-sparse mirror descent to p with ψP (p) = p log p
(see, for example, Section 5.3 of Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi
(2012) for the connections). However, EXP3 requires the
loss values be positive in order to be in the region where
ψP is strongly convex, so we scale our problem using the
fact that p and pt’s are probability vectors. Namely,

Using scaled loss values, we perform EXP3 (Algorithm
3).
Intuitively, we penalize the probability of the sam-
pled block by the strength of the signal on the block. The

scaling (5) ensures that we penalize blocks with low sig-
nal (as opposed to rewarding those with high signal) which
enforces diversity in the sampled coordinates as well. In
Section A.3, we will see how this scaling plays a key role
in proving optimality of Algorithm 3. Here, the signal is
measured by the relative size of the gradient in the block
against the probability of sampling the block. This means
that blocks with large “surprises”—those with higher gra-
dient norms relative to their sampling probability—will get
sampled more frequently in the subsequent iterations. Al-
gorithm 3 guarantees low regret for the online convex op-
timization problem (4) which in turn yields the following
guarantee for Algorithm 3.

See Section A.3 for the proof. Note that there is a trade-off
in the regret bound (6) in terms of pmin: for small pmin,
the ﬁrst term is small, as the the set ∆b is large, but sec-
ond (regret) term is large, and vice versa. To interpret the
bound (6), take pmin = δ/b for some δ ∈ (0, 1). The ﬁrst
term dominates the remainder as long as T = Ω(b log b);
we require T (cid:16) (bR2L2/2) to guarantee convergence of
coordinate descent in Proposition 1, so that we roughly ex-
pect the ﬁrst term in the bound (6) to dominate. Thus, Al-
gorithm 3 attains the best convergence guarantee for the
optimal stationary sampling distribution in hindsight.

2.4. Efﬁcient updates for p

(cid:80)d

The updates for p in Algorithm 3 can be done in O(log b)
time by using a balanced binary tree. Let Dkl (p||q) :=
i=1 pi log pi
denote the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-
qi
tween p and q.
Ignoring the subscript on t so that w =
wt+1, p = pt and J = Jt, the new probability vector q is
given by the minimizer of

Dkl (q||w) s.t. q(cid:62)1 = 1, q ≥ pmin,

(7)

where w is the previous probability vector p modiﬁed only
at the index J. We store w in a binary tree, keeping val-
ues up to their normalization factor. At each node, we
also store the sum of elements in the left/right subtree for

sampling from the binary tree in O(log b) time is given in
Section B.3). The total mass of the tree can be accessed by
inspecting the root of the tree alone.
The following proposition shows that it sufﬁces to touch at
most one element in the tree to do the update. See Section B
for the proof.

As seen in Algorithm 4, we need to modify at most one
element in the binary tree. Here, the update function mod-
iﬁes the value at index J and propagates the value up the
tree so that the sum of left/right subtrees are appropriately
updated. We provide the full pseudocode in Section B.2.

2.5. Example

The optimality guarantee given in Theorem 3 is not directly
interpretable since the term (a) in the upper bound (6)
is only optimal given the iterates x1, . . . , xT despite the
fact that xt’s themselves depend on the sampling probabil-
ities. Hence, we now study a setting where we can further
bound (6) to get a explicit regret bound for Algorithm 3 that
is provably better than non-adaptive counterparts. Indeed,
under certain structural assumptions on the problem similar
to those of McMahan and Streeter (2010) and Duchi et al.
(2011), our adaptive sampling algorithm provably achieves
regret polynomially better in the dimension than either us-
ing a uniform sampling distribution or gradient descent.

Adaptive Sampling Probabilities for Non-Smooth Optimization

While non-adaptive algorithms such as uniformly-sampled
coordinate descent or gradient descent have the same run-
time for all α, our adaptive sampling method automatically
tunes to the value of α. Note that for α ∈ (1,∞), the ﬁrst
term in the runtime bound for our adaptive method given in
Table 1 is strictly better than that of uniform coordinate de-
scent or gradient descent. In particular, for α ∈ [2,∞) the
best stationary sampling distribution in hindsight yields an
improvement that is at most O(d) better in the dimension.
However, due to the remainder terms for the bandit prob-
lem, this improvement only matters (i.e.ﬁrst term is larger
than second) when

In Section 4, we show that these remainder terms can be

where X ∈ Rd is a closed convex set and fi(·) are con-
vex functions. Let C1, . . . , Cb be a partition of the n sam-
ples so that each example belongs to some Cj, a set of size
nj := |Cj| (note that the index j now refers to blocks of ex-
amples instead of coordinates). These block structures nat-
urally arise, for example, when Cj’s are the examples with
the same label in a multi-class classiﬁcation problem. In
this stochastic optimization setting, we now sample a block
Jt ∼ pt at each iteration t, and perform gradient updates
using a gradient estimate on the block CJt. We show how
a similar adaptive updating scheme for pt’s again achieves
the optimality guarantees given in Section 2.

3.1. Mirror descent with non-stationary probabilities

(cid:80)

Following the approach of (Nemirovski et al., 2009), we
run mirror descent for the updates on x. At iteration
t, a block Jt is drawn from a b-dimensional probabil-
ity vector pt. We assume that we have access to unbi-
ased stochastic gradients Gj(x) for each block. That is,
E[Gj(x)] = 1
∂fi(x). In particular, the estimate
GJt(xt) := ∂fIt(x) where It is drawn uniformly in CJt
gives the usual unbiased stochastic gradient of minibatch
size 1. The other extreme is obtained by using a minibatch
∂fi(x). Then,

Let ψ be a differentiable 1-strongly convex function on
X with respect to the norm (cid:107)·(cid:107) as before and denote by
(cid:107)·(cid:107)∗ the dual norm of (cid:107)·(cid:107). Let B(x, y) = ψ(x) − ψ(y) −
∇ψ(y)(cid:62)(x−y) be the Bregman divergence associated with
ψ. In this section, we assume the below (standard) bound.
Assumption 2. For all x, y ∈ X , we have B(x, y) ≤ R2
and (cid:107)Gj(x)(cid:107)2∗ ≤ L for j = 1, . . . , b.
We use these stochastic gradients to perform mirror up-

Section 2.4, the updates for p in Algorithm 5 can be done in
O(log b) time. We can also show similar optimality guar-
antees for Algorithm 5 as before. The proof is essentially
the same to that given in Section A.3.

That is, Algorithm 5 attains the best regret bound achieved
by the optimal stationary distribution in hindsight had the
xt’s had remained the same. Further, under similar struc-
tural assumptions (cid:107)Gj(x)(cid:107)2∗ ∝ j−α as in Section 2.5, we
can prove that the regret bound for our algorithm is better
than that of the uniform distribution.

4. Experiments
We compare performance of our adaptive approach with
stationary sampling distributions on real and synthetic
datasets. To minimize parameter tuning, we ﬁx αp at the
value suggested by theory in Theorems 3 and 7. However,
we make a heuristic modiﬁcation to our adaptive algorithm
since rescaling the bandit gradient (5) and (10) dwarfs the
signals in gradient values if L is too large. We present
performance of our algorithm with respect to multiple esti-
mates of the Lipschitz constant ˆL = L/c for c > 1, where

√
L is the actual upper bound.1 We tune the stepsize αx for
both methods, using the form β/
For all our experiments, we compare our method against
the uniform distribution and blockwise Lipschitz sampling
distribution pj ∝ Lj where Lj is the Lipschitz constant
of the j-th block (Zhao and Zhang, 2015). We observe
that the latter method often performs very well with re-
spect to iteration count. However, since computing the
blockwise Lipschitz sampling distribution takes O(nd), the
method is not competitive in large-scale settings. Our algo-
rithm, on the other hand, adaptively learns the latent struc-
ture and often outperforms stationary counterparts with re-
spect to runtime. While all of our plots are for a single
run with a random seed, we can reject the null hypothesis

4.1. Adaptive sampling for coordinate descent
Synthetic Data We begin with coordinate descent, ﬁrst
verifying the intuition of Section 2.5 on a synthetic dataset.
n (cid:107)Ax − b(cid:107)1,
We consider the problem minimize(cid:107)x(cid:107)∞≤1
and we endow A ∈ Rn×d with the following block struc-
ture: the columns are drawn as aj ∼ j−α/2N (0, I). Thus,
the gradients of the columns decay in a heavy-tailed man-
j = j−α. We set n = d =
ner as in Section 2.5 so that L2
b = 256; the effects of changing ratios n/d and b/d man-
ifest themselves via relative norms of the gradients in the
columns, which we control via α instead. We run all exper-
iments with pmin = 0.1/b and multiple values of c.
Results are shown in Figure 1, where we show the op-
timality gap vs. runtime in (a) and the learned sampling
distribution in (b). Increasing α (stronger block structure)
improves our relative performance with respect to uniform
sampling and our ability to accurately learn the underlying
block structure. Experiments over more α and c in Section
C further elucidate the phase transition from uniform-like
behavior to regimes learning/exploiting structure.
We also compare our method with (non-preconditioned)
SGD using leverage scores pj ∝ (cid:107)aj(cid:107)1 given by (Yang
et al., 2016). The leverage scores (i.e., sampling distribu-
tion proportional to blockwise Lipschitz constants) roughly
correpond to using pj ∝ j−α/2, which is the stationary
distribution that minimizes the bound (3); in this synthetic
setting, this sampling probability coincides with the actual
block structure. Although this is expensive to compute, tak-
ing O(nd) time, it exploits the latent block structure very
well as expected. Our method quickly learns the structure
and performs comparably with this “optimal” distribution.

1We guarantee a positive loss by taking max((cid:98)(cid:96)t,j(x), 0).

Model selection Our algorithm’s ability to learn underly-
ing block structure can be useful in its own right as an on-
line feature selection mechanism. We present one example
of this task, studying an aptamer selection problem (Cho
et al., 2013), which consists of n = 2900 nucleotide se-
quences (aptamers) that are one-hot-encoded with all k-
grams of the sequence, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 5 so that d =
105, 476. We train an l1-regularized SVM on the binary
labels, which denote (thresholded) binding afﬁnity of the
aptamer. We set the blocksize as 50 features (b = 2110)
and pmin = 0.01/b. Results are shown in Figure 2, where
we see that adaptive feature selection certainly improves
training time in (a). The learned sampling distribution de-
picted in (b) for the best case (c = 107) places larger weight
on features known as G-complexes; these features are well-
known to affect binding afﬁnities (Cho et al., 2013).

4.2. Adaptive sampling for SGD
Synthetic data We use the same setup as in Section 4.1
but now endow block structure on the rows of A rather than
the columns. In Figure 3, we see that when there is little
block structure (α = 0.4) all sampling schemes perform
similarly. When the block structure is apparent (α = 6),
our adaptive method again learns the underlying structure

and outperforms uniform sampling. We provide more ex-
periments in Section C to illustrate behaviors over more
c and α. We note that our method is able to handle on-
line data streams unlike stationary methods such as lever-
age scores.

CUB-200-2011/ALOI We apply our method to two
multi-class object detection datasets: Caltech-UCSD
Birds-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011) and ALOI (Geusebroek
et al., 2005). Labels are used to form blocks so that b = 200
for CUB and b = 1000 for ALOI. We use softmax loss for
CUB-200-2011 and a binary SVM loss for ALOI, where
in the latter we do binary classiﬁcation between shells and
non-shell objects. We set pmin = 0.5/b to enforce enough
exploration. For the features, outputs of the last fully-
connected layer of ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) are used
for CUB so that we have 2049-dimensional features. Since
our classiﬁer x is (b · d)-dimensional, this is a fairly large
scale problem. For ALOI, we use default histogram fea-
tures (d = 128). In each case, we have n = 5994 and n =
108, 000 respectively. We use X := {x ∈ Rm : (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ r}
where r = 100 for CUB and r = 10 for ALOI. We observe
in Figure 4 that our adaptive sampling method outperforms
stationary counterparts.

Adaptive Sampling Probabilities for Non-Smooth Optimization

A.4. Proof of Lemma 2

From Algorithm 3, we have

αp(cid:98)(cid:96)t(xt)(cid:62)(pt − p)
=(cid:0)∇ψP (wt+1) − ∇ψP (pt)(cid:1)(cid:62)
= BψP (p, pt) + BψP (pt, wt+1) − BψP (p, wt+1).

(pt − p)

(15)

For any p ∈ P, we have for all p ∈ P,

BψP (p, wt+1) ≥ BψP (p, pt+1) + BψP (pt+1, wt+1)

≡ (cid:0)∇ψP (p) − ∇ψP (wt+1)(cid:1)(cid:62)

(p − pt+1) ≥ 0.

The latter inequality is just the optimality condition for
pt+1 = argminp∈P BψP (p, wt+1). Applying the ﬁrst
equality in (15) and summing for t = 1, . . . , T , we obtain

T(cid:88)

where η ∈ R is the dual variable for q(cid:62)1 = 1 − bpmin

Then, it sufﬁces to solve for η∗ such that

to a constant s. At each node, we also store the sum of the
values in the right/left subtree. Denote by w(1) ≥ . . . ≥
w(b) the sorted values of w. Let

that the optimal dual variable η∗ is given by

To this end, let J(η) := |I(η)|. For the optimal dual vari-
able η∗, we have that J(η∗) satisﬁes

w(J(η∗)) exp(η∗ − 1) ≥ pmin
w(J(η∗)+1) exp(η∗ − 1) < pmin.

from p(cid:62)1 = 1. Plugging this back into (19), we have that
f (J(η∗)) ≥ 0 and f (J(η∗)) < 0. Since f (j) is nonin-
creasing in j, it follows that J(η∗) = J∗ which show the
claim.
Next, we show that J∗ = b − 1 or b are the only possibili-
ties.
1. Case wJ < pmin: Here, wJ = w(b) since p ≥ pmin.

since pj = wj for j (cid:54)= J and pJ ≥ pmin. It follows
that J∗ = b − 1 and eη∗−1 = 1−pmin

2. Case wJ ≥ pmin: since

Adaptive Sampling Probabilities for Non-Smooth Optimization

over uniform sampling is smaller than in the coordinate
sampling case (Figure 5). We postulate that this is due to
the following effect: for an -optimality gap, SGD requires
O(R2L2/2) iterations, whereas O(R2L2b/2) iterations.
Since our bandit algorithm requires roughly O(b log b) iter-
ations to learn structure, it has more time to take advantage
of this structure in coordinate sampling before reaching a
given optimality gap. For SGD, our adaptive algorithm
does better than leverage scores when α = 2.2 which is a
result of learning a more aggressive sampling distribution.
Figure 7 analyzes the effects of stepsize on the performance
of our algorithm. Speciﬁcally, we consider the same syn-
thetic dataset as in Section 4.1, and we ﬁx the number of
iterations to 105. Varying the stepsize parameter β, we
track the optimality gap at the end of the procedure for our
method as well as uniform sampling. Although the sensi-
tivity to stepsize (the width of the bowl) appears the same in
both approaches, our method is able to handle larger step-
sizes (our “bowl” is shifted to the right) and learns more
efﬁciently for a given stepsize (our “bowl” is deeper) at
larger α. Importantly, we achieve these advantages solely
by tilting the sampling distribution to match the underlying
data’s structure.
Finally, we consider using the Gauss-Southwell rule for the
experiments in Section 4.1; similar to using blockwise Lip-
schitz constants, the Gauss-Southwell rule descends on the
coordinate with the largest gradient magnitude at every it-
eration. This method is inefﬁcient except for specialized
loss functions, as seen in Figure 8.

B.2. Update

We recapitulate that a key characteristic of our tree imple-
mentation is that at each node, in addition to the value v, we
store suml, sumr, the sum of elements in the left/right sub-
tree. Below, we give an algorithm that modiﬁes an element
of the tree and updates suml, sumr of its parents accord-
ingly. All node comparisons are based on their correspond-
ing index values.

B.3. Sampling

For completeness, we give the pseudo-code for sampling
from the BST in O(log b).

C. Detailed synthetic experiments
Here we present further experiments for Sections 4.1 and
4.2. Namely, Figures 5 and 6 shows experiments over more
α and more values of c for each α. This more detailed
setup illustrates the phase change in behavior: from em-
ulating uniform sampling at small α to learning and tak-
ing advantage of structure at large α. Interestingly, we see
that even though we are able to learn structure in sampling
over examples (Figure 6), the magnitude of improvement
